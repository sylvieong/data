You're sweet.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Tons
What good stuff?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Who?
Joey.
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
What?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
Thirty-two.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
She's partial to Joey, not me
Sure
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Away.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
A hundred bucks a date.
Do what?
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
An attempted slit.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
My mission in life.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I just need to lie down for awhile
Just let me sit down.
Who?
Pleasant?
C'mon.  It's not that bad
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
Go to the prom with me
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You're not helping.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
You don't usually ask.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
No?
Then you are too ambitious.
Call them.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
... and also to bring medicine.
How did you manage it?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
So was Christ!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
God be with us admiral.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut?  How much?
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
No!  Nothing happened.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
You ready?
Any I.D.?
Stay with her.
No.  I'm okay.
No.
I don't even watch TV.
Pretty.
So am I.
What's your accomplishment.
I'm not.
Yeah.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
No.  Are you proposing?
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
I have five-hundred dollars.
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Okay.
Okay.
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Sit down!
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
No, I don't get that!
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
A cheap hotel.
I'm here for movies.
That's what it looks like to me.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
He's my collar!
Yeah?  What kind?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
What??
Not good.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Yes, it is, Hal.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
How is gregor?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Opening pod bay doors.
Great, just great.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I got a lot to protect.
No way to start a partnership.
Luther was part of the gang?
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
We eat when I say we eat.
That's never been one of my problems.
The bet's off.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
Must be billy's girl.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Yeah.  Right.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Nothing.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Hey, you know what I really think?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Call me later.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Hiya, kid.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
Can't complain.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
First, the money.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Napoleon... small.
The girl?
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
That's what I'm saying.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
They are... with me...
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
I'll be right back.
Just one... why me?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
...The rain falls...
I want to sleep... forever...
Have you identified it?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Options.
Amen..
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
...I can't wait to be among you.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
Why the gun?
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
You're killing me...
Dino...
Machine.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Why?
You enjoy it?
What did you do with her body?
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Enlighten me.
Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Good for you.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
You don't have any other choice.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
Are you religious?
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
No...
What?
I don't want to.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
I know.  Uh...Alice.
"In her dream"?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
So?
What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Oh God!  He killed them!
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
No...
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Sobering...
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
But I've seen her grave.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
I want to talk about the baby.
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
But if they <u>do</u>?
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
I guess.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
We'll have to look for them later.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Oh it does???
Right, Skipper.
Why do you say that?
Anything ---
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
I met Dr. Kent, once.
Minus three.
- for horrors like yourself?
Why?
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Double A. New Britain.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
How'd you get the job?
Piece of fucking cake.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
But it's not funny now.
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Nothing.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
I'm fine, fine.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Maybe.
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Yeah.
We should talk.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
For a while.
How's she doing?
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Good.
Of course! I would've heard.
Wade.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
You remember Margie Fogg?
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Well, it was an accident.
What happened?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
That it wasn't an accident.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Yeah, no duh.
Don't you even want to ask?
Jim... for godsake!
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Alice... I...
Got it.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
We don't know that.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Because it is my duty.
About goddamn time.
A secret service agent. It must be.
why did they do that?
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
I know he left you behind.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Say something dear.
Jim...
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes?
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Got it.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
No. I thought about this, Mr.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
That's my job.
That just doesn't make any sense.
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
I mean until we start to burn up.
I mean for Ted.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
I guess this is a first for you.
So mentally ill?
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
He's a boy dog.
All right.  Here.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
You're sure?
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Yes.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
That's right.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
You expect me to believe that?
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
Uh-huh.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
Here.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
No. No thank you.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Yes...
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Nothing.
Did you talk to him?
Your mother mates out of season.
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
Tell me about it...
But there's no more drug.
Only holds five.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Ss'kya'ta'.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Yes.  That follows.
Could it be intelligent?
What?
See you soon.
Hear me out...
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
That's the plan.  My word on it.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Bullshit!
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
Are you finished?  You okay?
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Just get back here!
They're dead.
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
In a harem.
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
The marriage!
What did you think of the music?
Don't bother.
Hardly.
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
Now?
Why?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Fartsbishop!
Why not?
That's stupid.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Eat
Oh, leave me alone.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
You borrowed money from your mother?
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Oh, damn!
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
What?
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Give me two more weeks. Please.
Why not?
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
When, may I ask?
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Do you hear him? Do you?
Be careful!
Adorable!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
Yes. He is a little strange.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
Yes?
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Well, look at them.
Thank you, Sire!
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Yes.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
This one will.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Really? What is it he's writing?
I don't know. He has pains.
Are you Herr Mozart?
Can I see it?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
But this is absurd!
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Herr Sommer.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
Come. Let's begin.
I think so.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
What for?
Exactly. A dance.
No, but I'm the best.
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
But not his body.
Oh my son, my poor son!
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
You must be mad.
Never mind.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Dr. Hirsch?
Come to my office, Miss Price.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Dr. Hirsch?
Shall I send a car?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
Twenty-eight.
Shall I read to you?
That's easy enough.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
I was dreaming again?
Yeah, I would think so, too.
Lovely.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
A doper werewolf.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Pull over.
No.
Now see here young man.
No. You've had your chance.
I was having a nightmare.
Alex?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
I really don't know.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Right.
Wrong.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
No.
Yeah.
Where are we going?
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
What?!
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Nurse!
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
No.
Oh.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
Yes - sure
Yeah - sure!
No kidding?
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Aw, nerts!
Yes, sir.
What good will that do?
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
Take it easy, Clark.
Just pure luck!
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
We've been waiting fifteen minutes
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Fifty thousand dollars!
Me?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Thank you!
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Good morning.
Hello, Helen.
No, sir.
There you are.
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
Mine too?
Is it safe?
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Why?
Yeah.
Well, he was making love to her.
Mr. Williams . . .
Yes, why?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Are you sure?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Then where were you?
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
That was two hours ago.
You stay out of this, Bob.
How?
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
Leave me alone, Bob.
I swear --
It's tougher than it looks.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Nope.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Perfect, Cole.
Don't let it happen again.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
I'm out.
Well?
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Me get heap firewater --
So?
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
The posters?
And we're good at it.
Got any ideas, little brother?
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Can't argue that.
Everything but the boring parts.
And what's this right girl like?
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
And the same age Web was. No.
You been with a girl ever?
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
That is so gentlemanly of you.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
Yes sir.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
This is no game.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
So you can't tell me anything?
I can't believe this.
It's going to be a long spring.
Can you put men at all four?
Vengeance.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Courtney? Dinner?
Why?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Nice.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
Lucky, I guess.
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Leaving what?
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Patrick?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Yeah.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
No, really. I'm okay.
No problem. 
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
No. Not really.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Nothing.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
Well, I could he wrong.
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
Marcus?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Yes.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Another Martini, Paul?
No, Owen.
...But?
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
Teddy was killed last night.
It was a hate crime.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
I don't think he knows how.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Is it your dish?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
He's pretty tight with his family.
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
Oh. Yeah.
You look a little tired.
I'm okay. It's going well!
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
Let's go.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
...Were you?
No. Please.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Why's that?
The Day Care?
But why would they --?
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
No, no. Never.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
You'll come up with something.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
I met this girl.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
You may.
Care for some saki?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Oh, and Austin...
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
What?
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
Be careful.
Thanks.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
My mother's told me all about you.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
You know who.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Not now, Austin.
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
I'll hurry back.
Likewise.
I'll secure the perimeter.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Where did you learn to shoot?
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
My son?
Right.
Not me.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
... power ...
You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
You mean you don't recall??
We have met ...
Rules are made to be broken.
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
After the cold war ...
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
To find out who killed my husband.
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
I'm already married ...
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
Strange.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Did he say who?
No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
Very good, Steed ...
Any ideas?
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
Orders.
Is that all?
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
No idea who. No idea why ...
You didn't tell her?
Shall we?
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
What kept you?
Not quite.
Surveillance? By whom?
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
Global warming?
So you say ...
Dead, I'm afraid.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
She was ...
Perish the thought.
But did they teach you this?
Check out the other guy's buns.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
Cole...
Not interested.
I'm marrying Debbie.
Fan out and look for them.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
But how can I do that?
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
1002.
Yes, sir.
I'm going now, Cole.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Are you going to have women at your party?
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Let's get naked.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
You know your father enjoys his company.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Let's have a toast.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
I want women.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
What do you mean, it changes?
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeah, I guess so.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
Right in there, pal.
My Debbie?
You got it.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
This?
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Roll the hose.
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Saw what?
Thanks for calling.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Uh huh.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
It's a small town.
Sure you do.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Nice bunch of guys.
Then who wrote the report?
Yeah.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
I have a job.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Yeah? When was the last time?
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
You like everybody, Ronald.
I need to get in the trunk.
Alderman.
It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
Who?
You mean you could use it.
Yes.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
Yes, Sister?
Did he gots to be.
YEAH!
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
She's also moorish.
Damn skippy.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
That can be done.
We was coming to see you.
No costume.  No blackface.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
The name of the show?
I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Manray!
What point is that?
Sounds risky to me.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
I thought it was appropiate.
Do you have to be so damn forthright?
I feel fine.
Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
No.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
I just turned twenty.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
This is a travesty.  A debacle.
You've never had any formal training, either?
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
To come back to our roots.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
You leave something out?
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
I know I won't be your puppet.
That is none of your business.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
I'll match any man with the sword.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Your honor must lower his voice.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
What do you mean, alone?
It's... too slow.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Would you have believed me?
West... he's dead.
If not you, then who?
Bullshit.
Then who did?
But you didn't.
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
What kind of trouble are you in?
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
You're crazy --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
He's in interrogation?
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
You're off to a late start.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
So did I.
That's gonna stay my secret.
Get in.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Want company?
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
What are you talking about?
I don't think I want to hear this --
I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
Fifty minutes.
Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
You can't threaten me --
Wrong answer --
What the fuck are you doing?
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
Sir, yes, sir!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
There's only one I want.
Let's see it.
Don.
No.
That's terrible.
They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Well, it's not a short one.
So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
Jesus Christ.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
Okay.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You mean, while I'm here.
Can we talk?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
How what happens?
Yes. Exactly.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
Is he going to be okay?
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Really! That's wonderful.
Of course.
So you never bought any land.
Such as?
It is. I did it cooking.
Uh. Do you like England?
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
Syevodnya
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
What's wrong?
They go.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
In the world.
I do. I want to very badly.
What?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Yes.
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
You don't want to talk about it.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
Okay. Thank you.
Please. Why not?
Whatever.
Please.
It's more like a date.
Yes?
I need to uh...
Don't make it less true.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
No, ma'am.
Well, that makes it easier.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
You gonna miss your bus.
You been home yet?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You sayin' you'll do what?
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
What?
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
No ma'am.
Whose doin' is that?
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Let go of me...
GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
The... chain helps.
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
No, you do it. I can't sing.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You feelin' sick?
Yeah, I know.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Holy shit!
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
All that shit's on aisle 5.
Thought you had a man for that.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
First decent idea you've had.
I don't think he'd feel it.
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
I stole them.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
A snitch?
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
I'll check it out.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
I'm sorry.
Call for help.
How can you be so sure?
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
Who am I supposed to be?
I'm amused.
The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
He killed a police officer.
You had my help, detective.
The families who control the casinos?
You trust me?
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Nexus - 6.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Dr. Tyrell?
Tomorrow, he says.
Hello, glad to meet you.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Garbage man?
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Do you have something against science?
Prosit.
Four years.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
I'm taking a piss.
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
Can I come in?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
I'd kill it.
In your opinion.
Ugh.
So?
Can you?  I couldn't.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
Not too good.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
What?
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
Because it's not.
I'll see you in a minute.
Yes.
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
I never seen a turtle.
We sure did.
Just better.
What's your problem?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Thank-Q!
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Your mom was a dancer?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
You don't?
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
I know a short-cut.
How long would you need me?
Night!
Name it.
A wife?
Bites what?
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
May I please be excused?
Uh...yeah.
Well...yeah. Okay.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
How 'bout this one?
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Neat. Goodnight!
...I do.
Nothing.
Yes, sir.
I've got to go, now.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
No, son. A pitcher.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
You're sure?
Uh, I think they have.
And it's called...?
What's the capitol?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Almost all of them.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
He drank it hot?
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
You bet, hon!
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
No.  They all do.
Yes.
As long as we've got that straight.
The locks.
To go up.
How could you?! This is just like home!
Yes.  Well... yes.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Well, we did in my family!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Would you excuse me?
We do?
Excuse me.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
I see "elegant."
I think...it...works.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
And if we can't find him?
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
Have him committed.
Then what?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Is Sandy part of this?
Oh yeah, that's good.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
I, I don't know.
I'll go then.
What?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Who's it, you mean.
Yes. Frank--
Sure I do.
No police!!!  No police!!
Does that scare you?
Come on Dorothy.
I asked first.
You what?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Oh he forced you, huh?
My bourbon.
Can I feel 'em?
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Good, let's drink up.
Mom.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Alright.
That sounds great!
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Okay, Sandy.
It's good to see you.
Probably not. No. Why?
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
Oh fuck! 
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
You sound real remorseful.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
Our mother can see through bags.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Be careful.
Aye.
Aye.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good.
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Just like on TV.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Rule of thumb?
They were wearing masks.
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
The fat man.
New hitman wants to leave his mark
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Sweet-n-low!
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
You know them personally?
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Yeah boss?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
He's a nigger.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Yeah, I saw it.
That sets it off.
Eight dollars.
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
Dignan! Stop!
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I'll say it.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
No. We didn't.
Inez, this is --
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
Where was it parked?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
What?
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
That's not correct.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
What is it?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
It's like we've finally arrived.
Did that hurt?
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
Where's Kumar?
I'll get him.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
He did?
The grandfather clock?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Oh, I'd say about --
It feels good.
I don't want to die.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
Move.
I'm not playing any more golf.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
It was stupid.
Abdul-Shabazz?
Where were you?
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
My brother.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
What did I say?
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
My brother's in jail.
What are you talking about?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Just get in the car, Bob.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Man, I don't want to go into this.
What's that?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Good to know you, John.
What?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
There was a mistake.
Will it track back to us?
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
May I finish?
Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
I speak English.
You killed them.
Look at me.
Because you're afraid!
I don't know who that is.
I'm sorry.
-- what? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
Yes.
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
That's a lie!
This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
Felt promising. It's a start.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
Scotland. He intends --
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
A patriot!
We don't split up!
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
I need you so much! I love you!
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
You know the answer to that.
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
What? What could he do?
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
Straight up.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
So you believe me?
You know my father?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
What the fuck are you doing?
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Duck, here they come.
So how's Tommy?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Those are your clothes, silly.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
What?
Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
I get it. You can drop it now.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
I don't get it.
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
And you are...?
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Deal. Now read me something.
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
So you decided to go to America.
Oh, yes, please.
A champagne cocktail, please.
Yes, sir.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
And the other alternative?
Not an easy day to forget.
I will.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
I didn't count the days.
Yes.
Put them on the table.
No.
When did you first find out he was alive?
And Laszlo?
Because you're getting on that plane.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Yes, ma'am.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Goodnight.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
Apparently he has the letters.
Sam?
Rick? Who's he?
Not at all.
But we made a deal.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
May we proceed with the business?
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Good evening, Captain.
Thank you.
Mademoiselle.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
A wise foreign policy.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
Why two?
I have my orders.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
That is my least vulnerable spot.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Good. Then have a drink.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Get up, damn you.
You've had today's water.
No.
No.
I'm putting it off.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Why do they have to die for me?
Yeah, sure, what?
Nothing out there but ocean.
There was an unavoidable delay.
As much as anybody.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
I thought I did.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
He's your cute thing.
For when I travel?
There isn't any us.
Don't even start.
If I'd known you were alive --
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
My epitaph.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Not when you have no choice.
You too.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Which I didn't have.
Let's eat.
True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
The place is falling apart.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
No sweat.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
I'm *not* a doctor!
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
And that I can drive a truck!
I doubt it. She's just an...
Two.
I've never seen a lobster.
"King Kong". It's really good.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
Right.
It will be okay.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
Hi...
I can't go nowhere.
Why?
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
You mean somebody asked?
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
He's leaving...
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
A B-24 Liberator.
Is it true?
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
Nobody's named this one yet.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
Almost.
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Why was he missing for twenty days?
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
We're going to give him the money back?
Eight A.M. flight.
I'd like this cashed, please.
I have a good crew.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
I think two million.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Great. Thank you.
I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
We're not cops.
You interested in a little work?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Don't worry about it.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
Sounds respectable.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Where the hell is she?
You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I'm sorry.
This is embarrassing.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Of what? They're both crooks.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
Stand up.
Pretty much.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
I despise the job.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
A couple I know are getting married.
What?!
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
Looking forward!
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
You want me drunk?
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
I love you Jack, you know that.
Are you drunk?
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
It's not that.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
The debts.
I don't gamble.
Just an accident. Nothing.
You choose.
Then you're not a pro.
What kind of trouble?
And I thought you were a bright woman.
What about my neck?
Wait a minute...
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Have you got transport?
You've done pretty well.
No thanks.
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
They've been tested.
I make it six.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
Very impressive.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Doolittle, are you there?
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
The only thing which exists is myself.
That's it.
Of course not.
Yes, well...
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
So if you detonate in...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I'll check it.
Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Commander Powell is dead.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Phenomenology...
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
What're you talkin' about?
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Who's Camille?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
You're roommates?
Police drone.
I don't get involved with guns.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
Hello...
I don't want to move away.
Whoever that is.
Who is...
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
I won't be staying.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
No, I meant this.
The other ones?
Somebody's got to.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Open it.
Look, thank you for this but--
We're quoting Mom again.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
You're also a fool.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
You and me both.
What?
Yeah.
How long you and me known each other?
A long time.
A fog bank.
Please...
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
I actually know how this works.
She's got my word.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
True, but--
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
No, I mean... you love your son?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Oh, screw it!
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
I said, I'm sorry!
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
The KISS Army!
I don't even think you have a gun!
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Good MORNING!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
Our saviour...
Where did you come from?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Wonder where we'll be then.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Until it withers away.
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
The whole movie. Let's go.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
Where are we going?
Yeah...
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
I know, Dad.
I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
What about your family, Donnie?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
But you were punished.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
I think now that he might...
Where are we going?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Then how is time travel possible?
Goodbye, Donald.
What's her name?
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Come again?
Donnie? You're a dick.
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
"Here," wh-wh-what?
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Huh?
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Here, have some.
Yes...
Then it must be Wednesday.
Hi.
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
Shut it up, Loretta.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
All right, then.
The important thing is that we have a winner...
And the year before that?
I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
Close up shop!
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
"My"...
"My dear President"...
Take another letter...  to my tailor.
Take a letter...
I don't call him, I whistle.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
What did you say to her?
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
You worm!
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
I thought everything was working out fine.
One or two?
Oh, yes.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
I'll show you! I'll show you!
He must have taken quite a fall.
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Good! How is the patient?
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Romance!
You're English.
My... name is...
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Yes, John.
Yes.
Oh no, I couldn't.
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Welcome home, John.
YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
But, Father, it IS!
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
But surely you know...?
Erik. You don't understand.
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
It is day, of course, Freya.
Really.
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Yes?
Yes... oh, yes...
Looting and pillaging, eh?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
I don't know! I just did!
What's it all about?
You'll see!
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Why should WE care?
So?
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
To the oars!
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
We'd be the first!
He hasn't.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
No, I'm not.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
Oh...
You can't let Erik do THAT.
It's not my business any more!
So did your father...
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
And something to sharpen them with?
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Yeah, you told me that later.
You did? You liked me?
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
In the room?
In the world.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I like it.
Huckleberry Hound?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Sort of, um...
What?
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
Thanks.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Tomorrow?
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
I'm right here.
Yeah.
But you weren't. I could tell.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
What do we do?
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
yeah?
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Oh.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
I love you.
Joel, come here. Please.
That's okay. I --
Oddly enough, I do.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
How was it?
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
I'm sorry.
I miss you.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
We'll speak soon.
I better do this, Stan.
Where?
Once, maybe.
Well, thank you, Mary.
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
It's no big deal.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
It was a mutual decision.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Siwash, huh?
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
Hitchhiking?
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
Bonanza Jellybean?
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
Coffee.
No, thank you.
No, he didn't.
No.
A power drain --
He's crashing...
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
Starck!
I built it.
Skipper, you gotta help me...
The crew? Could they still be alive?
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
Justin.
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
Negative.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
It's complicated...
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
It's done.
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
What makes you think I'll miss?
Locked and cocked.
What is that?
We don't have time to fart.
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
Oxygen is not the problem.
Do it. Dr. Weir...
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
What's going on in there, Starck?
Justin's in the airlock.
He's dead...
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Not according to the computer.
It's cold.
Picking up magnetic interference.
Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Is it safe?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I had it at four.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Reed?... Sue?
Give me the god damn mirror!
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
Now.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Never better.
Great minds think alike.
That's good. That's uh... good.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Not at all.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Ben did this.
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
I'm just guessing.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
Leave me alone.
Mark is a really nice boy...
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Did you get her name?
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
So what makes you so sensitive?
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
Fascinating.
I thought he was out of town.
I like sex.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Climax together.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
That little prick.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Naked.
My heart!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
Not much. Why?
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
Us?
No, she's looking for you.
It's gone too far.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
Nobody. I'm the maid!
I fear nothing.
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
Spare me.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Who the hell would you call?
Well, justice is funny.
Easy.
What's it for?
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Shit!
No. You?
Your brother, huh?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
But --
He's dead.
He only shot you once.
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
Oh? And what's that?
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
Amazing you made it this far.
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Let's lock off this room.
I'm not lying.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
I'm not!
A rich actress.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
GET OUT!
Sort of.
Fired?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
...I see.
Really?
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
You really want to go?
Always. Always.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Daddy!
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Whattaya mean?
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
I know what ability you're interested in.
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
You're coming.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
Huh?
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I love you too, Frances.
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Why do you say that?
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Run!
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
What?
At one. Promise?
Yes, Mama.
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
Frances!
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Really? Any problems?
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Yeah?
And he drove me to mine.
The music? Or the fire?
You speak.
Kill me and have done with it.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
She's not for you.
It's been months. It's not like him.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
The world is a dizzying place.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
I will be here when you return.
Not as weak as I.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
It is
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Very well then.
As a march hare.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Thank you, Henry.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Philosophical?
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
Ah. An explorer.
I heard.
My name is Frankenstein...
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
You want to leave?
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
You okay?
Artist.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
Absolutely.
Okay.
Hey, guys!
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Ned!
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Best over...
There you are dead wrong.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Why not?
Sure.
Twenty-eight.
I said new, this is an '90.
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
The truth hurts.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
What's this about, money?
Come again?
Yes, they do.
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
In the Winnebago.
Amen.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
Scott?
What did I say?
Yes.
Yeah, we got a bible.
I'm really sorry.
Noooo!
-- you got your sink --
Whatsamatter?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Sight seein'.
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Really?
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
Where are you?
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
Entering my scan now...
I ain't gonna shoot her.
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Should probably ask him that.
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
I'd sure like to know who.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
And how do you know that?
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
That's a good story.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
No.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
This ain't even workin' wrong!
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
You made a mistake.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Only one way to find out.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
I got pretty close.
Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
Really? I'd like to find out.
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
What do I get?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Mr. Caiman...
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
What?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Not now. You got my bag?
I don't think so.
Have them sealed off.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Get your people out of there or I will.
Follow me.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
Thanks.
Sounds like a big company.
Sure.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Makes us look more American.
How do I do that?
Where are you?
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
THIS much.
Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
A boy comes to the door.
Could they be the miners?
Nobody was WATCHING?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
What?
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
But you don't?
What's the weather like outside?
I never get tired of that joke.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
OK!
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
Tell them? About...
I could have held on to YOU! ...
Gwen...
Because it was on the show!
Mark 12.
You are so full of shit
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
It's as far as it goes!
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
Because they're coming right at us.
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
And a French alliance?
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
The army can survive without me.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
A lot of years have gone by.
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
Lafayette will not be happy...
Delighted, sir.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
Yes, I believe so.
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!
Oh, come now...
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
What's the difference?
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
Surely you knew this was coming.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
It is; we need you George.
You know very well who it is that I love.
I'd throw everything away for you.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Africa, of course.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Voltaire, of course...
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
Juba was a Numidian.
He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
I guess still in the locker.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Farrah. Come here.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Harry, let me answer that.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
Get something going there.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
That's right.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
That's what I'm doing.
Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
One of his best parts.
He drown?
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Twenty seven hundred.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
I'll go. I'll go.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
You don't act like it?
I'm thinking about producing.
Pick 'n' Save.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Hello, Martin.
Thanks.
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.
Lemme see.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Maureen?
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
Bring it on, dude.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
I like my job.
If you get it back in one piece.
Threw a turbine blade.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
The right way and the wrong way.
Yeah, yeah.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
Maybe you can tell me then.
You smashed it!
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
What?
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
Collision? With what?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
We hit land.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
Let the buyer beware.
How's that?
We've done it before.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
Drink up then.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
Fine with me.
Yup.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
What?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Hello...
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Why?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Then why do you hate me so much?
When did I say I hated you?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
You loser.
Forget it...
How perfect.
Good.
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
God, it's so totally pathetic.
I've been looking all over for this.
There's my dad with Joanie.
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Which loser?
I dunno...
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
Not really...
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
Should we leave a note?
What? Where?!
Wait...
Just now... I went with Seymour.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
Don't worry.
You're insane.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Great...
I said "great"...
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're late, asshole.
Fine, and how are you?
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
Indian records?
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Okay.
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
Good luck...
I'm totally serious!
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
OH MY GOD!
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
What are you, a fry cook or something?
I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?
Are you okay?
It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
What, like a girdle?
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
So, what happened?
Really?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
Uh... sure... come in.
What about this?
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
I-I-I...
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Why? What did she tell you?
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Yes?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
There is no reason for fear.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
So that's what a lion looks like. 
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
Actually, no.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Because I think they're after you.
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
Once... 
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible. 
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Occasionally
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
You're really good, you know.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Hi, Egon.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
I know.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Maybe they just want to appeal.
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Oh, Ray --
I'm Peter --
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
I'm ready.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
Well, thanks a lot.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
So what do you think it was?
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
I know.  It happened by itself.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
You heard it?
Talk to my accountant. 
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
But why?  The students love us!
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Print is dead.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
What calls?
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Because you didn't say the magic word.
... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
I'm always serious.
It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
But it's my favorite state.
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
Look!
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Me, too.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Right.  We'll believe anything.
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
For the gods, spit it out!
Yes?  Go on!
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
Gladly Caesar.
Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
That this illness has clouded his mind.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Yes, Caesar.
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
God of passages and changes?
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
So I understand.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
Tomorrow?
What deal?
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
Let him trust Quintus.
Quintus is overly idealistic.
Narcissus!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Before they leave, get gold.
Are you going to graduate school?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
No, I couldn't.
Yes, I do.
I do.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Here he comes.
Well, I want you to leave.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
What did she say?
Goodbye.
What?
I don't know.
I'll think about it.
I just don't think it would...
Yes.
Shhhh.
Where did he do it?
Hello -- who is this?
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Are you listening?
Yes, I will.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
Ahhh.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Yes.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
It's in the main ballroom.
A single. Just for myself, please.
Will you sign the register, please?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
What?
Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Like what?
Sit down.
All right. Now finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Come on.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
What?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Very well. Thank you.
I haven't. No.
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Well -- goodbye then --
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Why don't you watch?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute.
Anything. Anything at all.
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
Don't you?
What?
He's asleep.
No.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Well I can't.
Not particularly.
What was your major?
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
You're not.
I see.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Thank you.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
What else?
You believe me, don't you?
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
What?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
What?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
You miss the point.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
They are?  Come on.
No.
Have you got that skeleton key?
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
No --
What about the money?
That.
Dictation.  You know...
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
You're very funny --
Sorry.
Anything for you.
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I should like to smoke.
You are beautiful!
No.
And what do you do -- now?
And now?
I'll go -- good-bye.
Shall I see you again?
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
If we could scare up some men to play.
All of that at once, Baron?
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
I did not ask your advice.
As you will.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
And the child isn't coming?
The Grand Hotel.
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Everything?
Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
Oh, don't go.
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
You pay me.
That's from skiing.
Skiing? 
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Not too quickly.
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
No -- now.
Oh, yes.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
I wish to be alone.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
Last night?... There was no applause.
Again?
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
We must call the police, your excellency.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
No news yet?
Good night.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
What's bluff?
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
What you need is some relaxation.
Your what?
Motherhood.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You expect me to buy this?
And if you do it wrong?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
These machines -- They're in here.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Perk, remember?
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
No. And you have to be.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Well, that's good news.
Just a few bucks.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
NO!
I can't. I just left home.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
Every day in every way.
You ain't seen nothin.
Oh, come on, Roy.
I'm a salesman.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
I thought these people were broke.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
What?  What for?
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Detective...
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
You sure?
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
John...
Where'd you get it?
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
Can I come in?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
What?
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Very insightful.
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
We can light our own tree at home.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
But I've seen him!
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
I've come to help your family.
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
Wait a minute ...
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
This is madness, Wynn.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Why did you take Jamie?
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
Um.
Can I have the Cadillac?
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Let's talk about something else.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I didn't know we had any women left.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
Me?
You're hollow, like a woman.
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
Everybody says he was so brave.
It makes life spicy.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
No, no, no, no, no.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Mom?
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Can I get dressed first?
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Who was it?
No.
Dad--
Heaven.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
What time do you get off work, my child?
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Some kind of animal?
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
Thank God!
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
You're wrong.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
What are you going to do?
Just one favor.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
Honor, I suppose.
Out!
You've killed women?
Would you say that again?
Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
Yes.
You haven't heard me yet.
I'm high as a kite.
King Arthur.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
I've enjoyed being man.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
What happened?
Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Oh, Paul--
Thank you, kind sir.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Don't know.
For Heaven's sakes!
Don't worry about it.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
He isn't any friend of Father.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
You figure!
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
Marry me instead.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
She quit this afternoon.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
The what?
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
I wish Paul luck.
They didn't murder me.
That's been said before.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
He died of a massive rupture.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
I just want to ask some questions.
Pull out your cock.
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
What's that shade of blue called?
Where's he?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Shit.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Where is he, Niki?
Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Yeah.
In G.R.? Why?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
Yeah. Probably.
I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.  A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Like what?
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
Who told you about this?
Okay.
That's all right.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
What do you think of that? Or this?
Com'on, tell me.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
The guy who bought you that ring.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
Was he with a girl?
Thanks.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Isn't this your vehicle?
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
What do you see?
Nice to meet you.
What?
Yearse!
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
Oh, look! The birds.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
No. 
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
That's a nice teapot.
I don't know. Just one of those. 
But we can't just dig it up!
But this is public property.
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
It is kind of rough.
What were you fighting for?
No more revolts.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Yes. It's almost there.
Yes.
Well, I really don't smoke.
Did Confucius say that?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Oh.
Here.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
But why now?
It's true. I can't live without you.
Mother.
Like a tea ceremony?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Ah, yes.
What about the draft?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
Yes.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
Oh sure.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Yes.
Souvenirs?
What's the chance of getting one of these?
Oh yes. That's fine.
I knew you'd come.
You knew?
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
It's coming.
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
What do you mean?
Kyle, you don't have...
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Story of my life.
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Got tired of me?
I can live with that.
I won't take 'em. They never work.
No. Don't --
Father's back?  Still angry?
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
Not hungry.
Not from you.
No. Myers is taking me.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
I like that...
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
What about you?
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
What?
Two steps back, please.
Just take it slowly.
Where's my father?
It'll go in.
It's just a puzzle box.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
I'm very happy.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
Hell...
So you were cheated.
Yes. They'll never find us.
Well we can't just stay here --
We'll move in Sunday.
You're done worse.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Can I get you anything?
I'll be down in a minute
Just soda.
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Am I?
Of course. This isn't a prison you know.  Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --
Steve.
No Dad.
Do you want me to come over?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
Really?
It's like she's waiting for something.
Show her.
It's late.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Yes way.  It's really...
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Good weekend?
No, that's okay.  Really.
'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.
Yeah.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
Yeah.
I dunno.
Think about it, Rob.
Not really.
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Is it better?
Is what better?  Better than what?
Of course it is.
We'll talk some other time.
Great... That's great.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
I guess I am.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
I don't want to go back.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
What's the difference?
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
I'm alright.
You're being stupid.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Ha.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
Would you marry me if I was?
Fair enough.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
You called this morning?
Is Ray going?
Good.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Yeah.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
It's in good condition.
You're very macabre.
Would you remember his name?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
Does Carl Smith?
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
I wish I could.
At least.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Just a little crazy.
He knows about you.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
Will I see you again?
Call your mother.  You never call her.
All fashionably without heads.
What are you getting at, Moran?
Yeah.
Stop!
Aye.
But you lived.
You know me home.  Me name.
Not even a single lifetime.
We are immortal.
This is madness!
You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
You will live.  Survive.
Go to hell.
Muy Bien!
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
I feel hardly nothing.
It's all we have.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Not likely.
Mulet.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
It never changes, Major.
He's a MacLeod.
Your father must be smart.
Figure she's with him?
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
You'd think he'd had practice.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
The last four.
Head still secure to the neck.
It's good to see you, Kahn.
And if I refuse?
Yes.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
What?
Seventy-five.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
The five hundred? Sure.
But --
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
No -- she didn't.
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Done what?
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
Just what I said. That's what I --
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
The insurance business?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Afraid? I should say not!
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
All the words you've got.
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
In a way.
Then why are you doing it?
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Where'd you wire him?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Walter, you can't do that!
You know you did!
You grey-haired old Judas!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
It's a deal. Let me up.
Me, too.
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Call you back.
Who engineered this getaway?
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
What did you do with her?
All right, Judge.
Phone for you, Hildy.
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Put down that gun, Earl.
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
What do you mean?
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
It's easy. I've done it.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
Air-raid?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
Except the servicemen.
And absent bridegrooms!
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
What are you going to be then?
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
Where to?
The ideas you get in your head.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
How are we going to cope?
Grace!
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
How long?
No, I told you...
Oh yeah, the tree.
That's not something to joke about.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
You shouldn't a done that.
Yeah, I'll do something.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Holy crap, thanks!
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Yeah, no shit.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Hell yeah.
How much further?
I don't know.
What's that?
No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
What I need are some answers. 
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
I hear ya.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
That seems likely.
So.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Shhhhhh.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
You find something, Georgie?
Huh?
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
You said it, not me.
No, just a little too old.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
Fit the profile?
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Where we headed?
That's it?
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
We found one.
And?
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
Is everything fine?
Yes. Happy happy.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
You are sweet.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Gabby, what is it?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
God, you're beautiful.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I want to be the way I was before.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Always. Ow.
Won't he be able to tell?
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
One night stand?
Yeah. My brother told me.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Nathan told my brother.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
Yes, and...
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
You do?
Why certainly!
Absolutely.
I think he's feral.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
What?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Nothing. Be right out.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
That's great.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
How come?
Shit.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
That's right, Miss Packard.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
To win.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
How much do I owe you?
Sit down.
In that case, you owe me another drink.
Why?
For who?
You think I can lose?
Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
Where?
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
I got time, Bert.
Fifty per cent?
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
You name it, we shoot it.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
Fast and loose, man.
I feel tight -- but good.
I asked around.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
You're a pretty good player.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
What bus?
Thanks. I will.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Around.
So why go to college?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
You want to go with me?
I've got something in my bag.
From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
You wanna drink?
He knows. A lot.
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Is he a winner?
Is that what makes a winner?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
For how long?
Oh, grow up.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
Twelve. Cross side.
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
We move.  Place to place.
Who?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Let's check it out, Dad.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
I'd believe him.
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
What? -- I... 
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
You have to leave the White House.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Love was never our problem.
Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
What happened?
Just do it!
Checkmate.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
Great.
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
Really? You don't mind?
Really? Ballet?
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
So push it!
That'd be cool!
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
Above American soil?
You've got it!
All my life!
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
The Name of God...
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Yes?
I knew it was you --
Pretty sure.
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
You said go between them!
I said don't go between them!
Uh-huh.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
Where is it? I want it.
Out!
Junior!
I'll never forgive myself --
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
And the chair.
I'm out, Dad!
...the solution presents itself.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
Dad, how can you?
This could be close.
The penitent man. The penitent...
After you, Junior.
Yes, sir!  Haaa!
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
You don't like him do you?
What?
Two are still missing.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
Somehow I feel safer in here.
First of all -- don't panic!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
What does the writing say?
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
You're talking to an authority in that area.
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
Quiet!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
I want to go home...
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
Not quite.
Figures...
Who was it?
This candid camera?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
That a new Datsun?
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
You said it.
Are you crazy?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Then I'm crazy.
I'll tell you what to say.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
Why?
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
You are CRAZY!
Thanks.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
I'm not leaving until you do.
I'm not gonna make it easy.
Take a left and your next right.
Where are we going?
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Why not?
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
You leave my glands alone!
What is it?
What? What do you mean?
What?
That's a big if.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
What if she says something important?
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
You found her.
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
You have to! Quickly!
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
Not sure at all.
...Shit! It's just money.
Dieter!
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
What part what?
Don't worry.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
What a nerve!
You have nothing...
That name's familiar.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Well what?
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
I noticed you staring.
Thanks, I appreciate that.
What's what?
Blake?
Me still. They left you alone?
It's not apparent.
Can I help?
You are.
How often they come here?
And you, what do you like?
They kidded me a little.
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
No, he didn't do that.
You did.
He must be a good friend.
What'd he steal?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
How do you know you can trust me?
Hiroshima.
Beats me.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Oh.
Can you?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
Now what?
It was my choice.
For you.
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
He told me what to do.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
How long?
You got a deal. 
I'll be there.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
What do you mean, what's it do?
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
I'm not touching my film...
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
How grave?
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
I don't understand.
Use the bathroom.
That's for food.
Yeah.
They're killing the Wigand interview...
I got perspective.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Alright?
All right. See you...
Hardly new news.
What do you mean?
Good.
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Alright. What did you think?
Oh, please, Mike...
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
What I've seen... I've liked.
If you want to do it.
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
You okay?
...okay.
You believe that?
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
I'll call them, Lowell.
I heard.
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
There is -- there is no family.
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Poor communication skills.
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
You threatening my family, now, too?
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
You did good, Massey!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
After you, Doll.
What part?
Is that... one person?
Mr. Dumbarton.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
He's the wrong man.
So, that's good, right?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
Gotcha.
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
Your mother was.
No.
Do you want to sleep on it?
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
No buts. Now. Out.
You do? You do love me?
Hello Miles.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Murder?
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
You used his credit card.
She did a Harriman.
Oh, God!
I'm dying.
Hello Miles.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
She's here now.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
My client has ruled that out.
Ha Ha.
Heh heh.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
How is she?
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
South America!
Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
Oh, please, Dad
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
If you really mean it, I will.
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Yes, sir.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
But the lady says
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .
All right, let it go.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
What for?
Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Like what?
Hurry up and get dressed.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
Yes.
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
I'm following you.
This isn't "piggy-back."
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking
Raw?
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it
Clever.
Amazing.
What for?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
We don't need forty cars.
Yeah, swell.
Same to you.
I'm out! I'm out!
Won't I ever see you again?
Left twenty minutes ago.
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Oh, excuse me. 
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Don't "Joe" me.
What!
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
I dunno.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
Sh-sh-sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
You love them, don't you?
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
And Oswald?
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
Gee, thanks boss.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
There's a word - orders.
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
Why?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
No, I did not.
What did they...
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
What was so appealing about Houston?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
What?
Hi, Freckle Face.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
No.
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
No.
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Allen Dulles?
We need him back.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
If you must know, virtually nothing.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
And what would I have to do?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
I won't forget.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
Course you didn't.
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
What's she willing to give us?
Beauty products.
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
That doesn't sound dark.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
It was the other guy who busted me.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
It looks nice.
Are you?
We talked.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
Why?
What do you do when he comes home?
And is that it?
Which one?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Where's the rest of it?
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
He say is a surprise.
I know what it looks like.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
Not really.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
Si.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
Beaumont Livingston?
Got some o.j.?
I knew it.
I understand woman, damn!
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
I don't know. One of your friends.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Designer clothes.
Where you gonna be during all this?
Four years?
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
No.
You been to Japan?
That sounds like a problem.
You live with him.
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Who's your partner?
As low as two.
Guess where I am?
What did he do?
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Not now, pick me up.
Twice. In the parking lot.
Pretty sure.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Fuck you for asking me that.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
They don't have your winning personality.
Yeah.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
Uh-huh.
She will.
I know where to turn.
You know it's for you.
I'll give you his beeper.
Then what are you doing here?
No, thanks.
LET GO!
That's right. We did.
Tell your mother.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Who?
Sarah.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
Wiggle your toes.
What? By myself?
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Yes.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
It's not healthy with it closed.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
I don't know.
Jezzie, I can't see.
Who? Jed?
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
The best.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
What?
Not to me.
When was the last time I said a word?
They weren't human!
Where are we?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
Get your clothes off.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
What's he talking about?
I don't believe this.
I can do anything I want.
Are you out of your mind?
I promise.
Please.
Where are they?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
You've lived with me for two years.
You can have anything you want.
Mid-town mostly.
Sit down, Jake.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Like it was yesterday.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
We're not going to hurt you.
Call my chiropractor.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Died?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Is he all right?
Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
Pause play.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Done?
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Get out of here!
He....He...
He came for me, I had to run!
Cool.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
I think I broke my arm.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Not a chance.
Give me a break! What happened?
Oh sure, all the time.
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Shut up, Thorgan!
NO!
You prefer an apple?
Maybe she tripped.
Kay-em 14.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
You need to get laid!
Are there any other shuttles?
Oh shit! There he is!
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
Are we locked down?
What have I done?! Idiots.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Here --  Take him home.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
It's my charter. My party.
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
Full throttle! To port!
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
Don't be silly - You're going to make summer better for them...
I think they make you look sexy.
He's sitting in it.
You going to be all right?
Do I need any more authority?
I was only reacting to what I was told.
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
No, we just checked the beach...
There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
Just keep kicking.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
Let me see your hands...
Ever see one like this?
He's under!
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
Thanks for the message.
I know.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Well, I do.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Were we together?
I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
Um, hi?
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Shut up.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Like what?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Junk?
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
Hey, I like this.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
Why?
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Nothing...
I went to the doctor today.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
You're pregnant?
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
You mean like couples?
Is this Juno?
Unfortunately, yes.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Well, you are kind of... convex.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I suppose anything's possible.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
So you don't do any of those things.
Sure.
Took 'em all.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
What do you need a Bible for?
How much do I owe you?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Thanks. What are you doing?
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
Nervous?
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
How many times have you gone unprotected?
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
She can fuck?
How?
Den less go Joe.
They're gonna tell their grand kids.  That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
You got any money?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
So.
Yeah.
Yeah me too.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
You have?
At the block party?
Yeah.
Nothing?
What do I want to do?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
What?
Everything is wrong.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Yeah?
Who, Benny's little sister?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Sweet.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Holy shit. That's all true?
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
But then I won't need your money.
Hello?
Nah.
Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
No.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
I'm positive.
Run it down.
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
What was your relationship with her?
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
What do you mean, stand out?
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
I haven't got time for this.
Just a second.  Hello?
No, only the path she chose to travel.
Why her?
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
Let me speak to my daughter.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
No problem.  We're in.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
The most logical choice.
You don't have a shred of evidence!
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
I suppose you have something in mind?
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
About what?
Whatever's on your mind.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
What are they, please?
Yes.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
I don't think I could.
In a way.
Of course.
Because I think he's wrong.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Are you going to come tonight?
I got lucky.
There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
Do we have a future?
I'm sure you are.
I'm not nervous.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
<u>What</u>?
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
I knew you would come.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
You will know, in good time.
He has come for Lyssa.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Never.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
Yes.
Staying alive.
You and I will guard the fire.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
To the place where Death lives.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
No. He will master the leader.
Freylag's stronghold?
A fine match.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
You had a son.
I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Yeah... How do you know it?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
...What?
Good.
130... 140...
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
...Yes.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example...  And forgetting all this...
I don't know... Five minutes.
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Huh, that's good!
Huh? Why?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
For a walk.  I don't know.
I don't accept that.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
It'll make it.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
That's a reasonable assumption.
About my love for her.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
Out of the car.  He jumped out of the god damn car!
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
Is that right?
Yeah!
Nine.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Mammoth.
The Gazette's small huh?
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
She never ate a slice.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Saluting.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Hello.
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
Evening News?
No.
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
Right... OK...
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
What do you mean?
Yes... I'll give you that.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
Where are you staying?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Sera... please go.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
No.
Where you got in the shower.
Tell him, Paulette.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
Spill.
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Josh proposed!
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
What?
Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
And I fully support that.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
No, silly. I go here.
You go where?
You got into Harvard Law?
Now I am.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
I don't expect you'd understand.
My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  I suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
And, now?
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
I didn't know... I --
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
What!
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
What does she want from me?
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
Fie on what she thinks!  You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
The colt's still too small.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Stealing his arms?
Ogg's footprints!
Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
What weapon?
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
I was with the Princess.
And did you?
Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Liar!
Be patient.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
To fetch your napkin.
They tricked you.
Then, perchance you'll me.
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Lili... I love you!
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Thought the weather terrible of late.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
No!
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
And sweet?
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
Sam!
It's so beautiful.
Mom said I should.
And why was the alarm on?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
No.
Why?
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
What are you doing here?
No thanks.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
Why are you so stupid?
Not really.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
It could have been a squirt gun.
You've been good this week.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
It's thirty feet.
Well, if it is, we have a problem.
What are you on?
How old are you?
Forty.
I hate this job.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
Yes, it is.
I'm sorry.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Not a shower.
You're here early today.
Why would you be there?
Because I live there.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
I'll hate you forever.
I almost saw Catalina.
It bugs me.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
I don't know.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
I'm not even listening.
Hi, Mom.
What would you like to be?
I'm telling you now.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
She seemed upset.
I still don't know what that means.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
I know there's an explanation.
I need you to do me a favor.
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Where have you been for a week?!
The garage.
When's school over?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
No, you don't.  Trust me.
Sam's favorite.
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
Finished or unfinished?
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
That was the truth.
You've never said that before.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I can't pick you up.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Left you?
So could I.
It's not my back that's killing me.
Does Alyssa know?
Take it off.
I guess I could teach you some things.
That's my girl.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Sharp.
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
Want me to come back some other time?
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Start your job? What kind of job?
That's some long green.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Here I am.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
Forget it.
What do you want, Claude?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
You still got that map?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
Make 'em throw strikes.
Crop duster.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
Goodnight, Ray.
Don't touch that car.
I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
What'd you say?
I said you're soft.
Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
You didn't get ketchup?
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Movin' it out, boss.
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
He must still be in there.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Jenny?
That's a long story...
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
Yeah, you do...
It's not me, moron.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
What was it called, sir.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
So I followed him...
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
I'll just go to Heaven.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
You think I'm a tourist?
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
"Octopus people?"
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
You have a dog? What kind?
Good. I was concerned.
Are you dead?
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
From my dad's side of the family.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
I feel sorry for you, boy!
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Your own work?
Just the face.
Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go?  I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
You prefer women?
Sad? What made you sad?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
And?
And now?
Why is it wrong to run?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Why tell me?
It's different now. Help me.
I let him go... believe me.
I don't..
What do you need?
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Some people say children need human mothering.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Muscle? I don't know that one.
No. Not that either.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Is it inside the city?
Yes...
Are there any other humans?
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
Not yet.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Oh, yes... I think...
Too little.
What is?
Yeah.
What's that, Ed?
Yeah, I remember.
Me, too.
We should stop seeing each other.
No... no.
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Andy?
Yeah. Call him.
Okay...
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Yeah? what did they want?
No.
Pete, what happened to you?
Coming up.
A headache?
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
At your house. Don't you remember?
At your house.
Wake me up when you get home.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
When you didn't come to the club.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
Called? When?
Who the hell owns that dog?
Two detectives are coming out.
I wish I knew.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
I can see that.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Okay.
Yeah.
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
You really don't remember?
Come on... get in.
Fossils.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Have I?
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Okay, Lovey.
Come on, Lovey.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
It's unbelievable.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
108 and still active?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Why, no.
Splendid!
Are you so certain you are away from it?
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get outporters or no porters!
Yes.
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Mine?
You?
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
Yes.
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
What do you mean if we should get out?
That's what you said.
Uh-huh.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Oh, George . . .
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
That fellow got on at Baskul.
What if he refuses?
What do you suggest?
I'm so glad.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
The hell were you thinking?
And if I say yes?
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
Actually, sir--
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Home?  You gotta be kidding me.    Black?
Kay...
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Sir, you can't just--
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
Right.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Kay!?
You coulda told me what you were doing.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
So... how did they get here?
Out of focus?
I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.
You're not taking me in!
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Noon exactly.
I promised I wouldn't tell.
This guy.  Where was he?
May I have a look?
Wait-- listen--
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Actually, I don't know...
Agatha...
Someplace safe.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
What --
Right.  I know --
Yeah --
Why?
You set your patients on fire!
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
What?
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
Can you fake the cerebral output?
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
Georgetown.
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
If it's a question of authority.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
Wanna hear something funny?
What the fuck is going on?
Who made you do this?
The what?
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You say some of the children died?
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
The safest place of all.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
The female.
Then how did he --
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
None of your damn business.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
There's thousands of units like this one.
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
Knott!
Who?
Have you been there recently?
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's great, right. Is he great?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Go.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Ho's a good guy --
I want you to quit.
I'll support you.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
Get your hands off of her.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Your dance is over.
You driving her?
So, when's the drop.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
Brooklyn.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
Where's Ricky?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
What?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
I know.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
We get it. We're sorry.
Nah, man...
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Ricky's taken care of.
Thanks.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.
Who's driving her?
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
Well, I don't want to walk.
So they said more than the address.
Don't even start.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
You got something to say --
I don't know.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
Like I said, I don't know.
He woulda told us right?
So we're working?
Back in.
All the more reason.
Eighty bucks?!?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
Where do you get this shit?
You're not getting a gun.
Easy...
I'll be a minute.
I didn't do anything --
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
You see a Ricky Slade?
S'up.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Watch it...
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
The Soho Grand?
Thanks.
Tell me.
Yes, sir.
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Lemme write it down for you.
Yes, sir.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
I don't want your money.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Yeah.
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
Elijah who?
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
What for?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Where am I gonna start?
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
I know.
Because you're in trouble.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Let me die then.
Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
You hear me, girl?
So what about him?
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
Allah will provide.
I don't know shit about you.
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Where does he live?
Give me the address.
[Don't lie to me.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[I want you.]
[Lucky how?]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
Yes.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
If they like me.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Time will tell.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
Because...  I was already dead.
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
It's Creasy.
What was her name?
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
[Yes.]
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
That's ridiculous.
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[I think he's... magnificent.]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
And they took that away.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
Down there. That little one there.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
Are you kidding?
Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
Who told you that?
Oh.
What happen?
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Yes, I know.
Marty...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
What didn't you like about her?
...and they sit down right next to me...
Hiya, Ralph...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Hiya.
This is a good deal here, Marty.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
Well, I don't know what you want me to do, Virginia. If you want me, I'll go talk to her tonight.
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
He's parted his moorings.
Never this close.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Where?
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
I don't drink intoxicants.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
Sixteen times.
Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
What do you think, Trapper?
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
Any time. Whenever we want.
We're a good team.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Not necessarily.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
Ayuh.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Maria...
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
I didn't mean with me.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
What's the story?
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
You guys got any black capsules?
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Splendid, sir. No problems.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
Boys, we're home free.
Yeah, I'm all right.
Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Money.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Wait a minute . . .
Huh?
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
There is no letter.
There is no letter. I made it up.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
John Doe.
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Well, you're catching on.
What bonus?
Well, maybe you're right.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
Where's Connell?
Where'd you play?
Shut up!
What?
Look!
The heelots!
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Who are they?
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goodsa fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
The elevators are still runnin'.
Yeh.
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
That's got nothing to do with it!
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Good night, John.
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Not that we know of.
Good. I don't want to be late.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
You can't help me, man.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Automatic.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Roper, we're into it...
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
You don't like New York?
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
Is there something wrong with that?
Well, if I have to, I have to.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
I think I can handle that one.
No.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
To save lives.
Still needs work.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Maybe you should be.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
Yeah that's it.
Just now.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
Your concern is heartwarming.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
What happened to your Trans Am?
What have you promised them?
What do you want?
Because I took it out of your memory.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Yes.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Then what?
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
I'm South Dakota.
Who?
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
And you weren't involved.
What?
Who are you?!
Corporation can.
It was a test.
Realize?
You weren't real.
What's the difference?
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
This.  No point to it.
Just like that?
Describe program function.
-- Waiter.
TRICERATOPS!
I think so.
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
We can take these guys!
We could smell it's breath.
A stellar idea, Skull.
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Look closer.
And I ain't no nigger either!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Whatever you say, Boss.
You scare me, Charlie.
What do you mean?
Scared.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
Shane was a friend of yours?
That's it.
Same here.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
I'm doin' business here!
But there's...
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
I'll do fine.
I told you twenty!
What's your problem?
Never threaten me, Boss.
What the fuck does that mean?
You gotta plan these things.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
But that's an hour's drive.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
And the Jews?
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Fuck 'em.
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
Now that's a hard number.
Just wanted ta say hello.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Stu Miley.
Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
Bend over?
Less.
Uh huh. And?
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
I don't think so.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
Give me a date, Doctor.
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
We like to think so, yeah.
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Yeah.
Moscow.
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
It was?
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
No!
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
How about getting married?
Any time.
Okay. You don't mind?
No.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
I'm getting out of there. Right now, Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
That infernal phone!
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
All right, why?
Washington! Always discussing the problems of Washington. Nobody ever thinks of the State--and my problems!  I *will* tell Jim Taylor. It's high *time* I told him a thing or two! 
Horace Mill--!
*But you never asked me*!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
The--head?
Uh--could--could I help--?
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Thank you, sir.
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Ah, now, that's better.
It does!
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Sorry about this, Governor. But it won't take a minute. You were saying something in the other room, sir--
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
*No*!
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
You *couldn't*?
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Right.
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
Go right ahead.
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
In Terry Canyon?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Do you want to dictate them?
Oh--*Saunders*!
Don't mention it--
I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
I'm not.
Well, I guess it's a chance.
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
Where do we go from here?
Goodnight, Senator--
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
I know that.
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
No?
You're the best nurse I can think of--
He's lost complete faith in me--
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
You won't stand for it?
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
Just a minute, Joe!
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
He was a seven-months baby.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Uh-huh.
Why not?
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
You are , aren't you?
What did they say?
What did they say?
What are they going to do?
Gosh! What do you know about that!
What did he play?
Let's just walk, okay?
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Mary - I - excuse me
Don't be ridiculous.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Hello.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
Hurry up!
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Yes, sir.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
Nuisance value?
Wants to know who the heir is.
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
Uh-huh.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Why, it's an artistic institution
Naturally.
Why not?
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
Well, thanks, I - uh  How do you do? What is your name?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
Uh-huh.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
Don't pay any attention to her.
Where is your farm?
Yeah. What?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Yes, sir.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
You must have been concerned.
Could you come with me please?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
Why not?
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
Now we're back on track.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
I've had my moments.
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
I do.
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
That's right, the fake kind.
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Be specific.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Which thing?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Sofie...
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
Was it something that happened at school?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Uh-huh.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
It's not?
It matters to me.
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
I'm honored.
Wow.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
In the desert? What for?
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Try me.
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
You swear?
What did you find? What did you see?
I found sand. I saw death.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
The things that get you excited.
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
FINE.
Got what?
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
Yes,... I see.
Um, well, you see...
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
I know you knew I'd know.
Um-hmm.
It must have slipped my mind.
Your mind is so slippery.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
And some sandwiches --
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
How's your dad?
Get on to yourself!
Are you with me... or against me?
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
You underestimate yourself.
Why not?
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
I guess... Are you always so angry?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
And what if you get killed?
Bye. 
We had an off night, that's all.
Not a chance!
But look at him... and look at us.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Or flowers.
Shhh.
Anybody got any?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Ow.
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Shut up.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
I did, sir.
Are you serious?
You could have them here by daybreak.
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
Ah-hh, no.
When you eat him, may I have some?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
Why didn't you wake me then?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Oh...?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
Why did you give it to him?
My God, what do you think?
How do you know?
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
Oh, then you are...
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Yes, sir.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
Anything you need.
Thanks, Unc.
Yeah.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
What happen?
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Fuck, what's his name?
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
I can't taste nothing.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.  It came certified mail.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
I don't.
Ain't no windows in here.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
No.
Wait for what?
I will.  When can I come visit?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Okay.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Come on.
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
Let it go!
Thanks for the help.
Call me.
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
What you doing to my nephew?
What's he doing here?
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
You just come in on Amtrack?
What?
The grave. Somebody close?
Its'...ah...about my daughter....
I...
I'd like to know what...
I will do no such thing.
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
Tell me why I miss him.
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
You know what I'm gonna do.
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
But...
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
How did you see us kiss?
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
It's a twenty.
I remember. The big tipper.
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Oh, Jesus ...
Yeah.
You're going to go see her.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
Fuckin' A.
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Everybody does?
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
They hid in a broom closet!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
Fiddlesticks!
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
Blue men.
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
Sshhh...
She's gone to Moundsville.
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
I'll make coffee.
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
It -- she --
Come to me, boy!
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
No.
Because John said I mustn't.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Them kids is yours?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
None of your business, Madam.
When did I ever?
What you been up to?
Pearl and John.
I sure as hell hope so.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
You know he's dead though, right?
She lived there.
I don't mean her --
Krueger?
School.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
Just sleep now, Mom.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
No more fights?
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
What is it?
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
No, that's bad management.
No, no.
Why should you be afraid?
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
With two f's, if you please.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
The Duchess...
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
That's perfect!
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
I think she covered you with the parasites.
Comrade.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Business.
What business?
Confess what?
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
At what intervals does he whistle?
Yes.
Is that customary?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
You are something we do not have in Russia.
Let's forget that we ever met.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
I don't like your following me.
I always eat here.
This is a place for workmen.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Why?
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
No.
I don't think so.
No.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
A funny story?
I must talk to my brothers!
No speech.
Not white, darling.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Let's turn on the radio.
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
It is their wish.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
How do you do?
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
No thanks, Swana.
All right, I'll listen.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
What is this, Swana?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chteau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
Madame, if you...
In that case I can only say good-by.
Unfortunately.
May I have your bags, madame?
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
Please... sit down.
No.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.
How do you do, my friend.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
No, we have nothing to hide.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
You think this is just about politics?
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
I thought the gloves were off.
I don't have a pistol.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
Let him finish, Bob.
I believe you're right, boss.
Sir?
We ought to fire his whining ass. Right now when he's on top.  You know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration.
How?
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
Harold ... can I get you anything?
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
The old queen did it on purpose.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
I mean I got federal price controls on my oil.  The ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
We have to entertain the possibility ...
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Why?
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
... but it was all we had.
You're shittin' me.
Where you from?
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Yes, I understand that.
What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I?
Yes, yes.
Well, we could delete it.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
Amen to that.
Yeah ... I'm out.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
And then you'll be happy?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
Tomorrow.
And what am I doing?
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
Yes ma'am, I do.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
You sure?
Mm.
That's possible.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes Sheriff.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
Yes. Things fall into place.
At the gettin' place.
No. I found it.
What? Quit hollerin'.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Yes I do.
You should be used to that.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
I can't say.
Is Llewelyn there?
Not a bleep.
You from around here?
I don't know.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
I don't know. I couldn't say.
For what?
How's that?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
I'm sorry.
Half.
Were you in Nam?
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
You do, I reckon.
No sir.
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
No, Elden, I need to...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Did you send anyone out there?
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
Yeah?
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
I'd rather not...
I don't think I am.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
I gotta go.
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
David, please --
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Thanks...
What's so special about it?
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
Yes.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
Dr. David Ravell.
Like Rome?
You made out alright.
You're hurting him!!
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
How many men have I talked to?
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
HE IS REAL!!
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
You should have a little faith in people.
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
If we're for real?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
A doctor on the show... why?
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
I don't know, George...
No! Let me try this!
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
David Ravell.
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Do not seek the treasure!
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Suckin' away.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
You didn't know that at the time!
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Thank you, sir!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Who gave you this idea?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
I didn't call you anything before that.
No, sir.
Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!
Yes, sir!
Yeah.
Or we could do that yeah.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
Really?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
Me, too.
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
That's okay. I'm used to it.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
I've seen better.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
It's mine.
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Yes.
Remember that.
She better.
You're an idiot.
The fuck did you bring a gun for?
I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
Shut up and let me think.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
I did.
Adios.
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
The crowd goes wild.
It doesn't work?!
Yeah.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
To prove he wasn't chicken.
I am.  I'm here.
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
On it!
He won't even know who it was.
He --
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
Fuck that, we've got company...
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Who's they?
You know that's bullshit.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
No Fuck you!!!
You joining? My Brother..  My brother.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
You mean...
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
Alone...
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
No you wait a second. You and your "Panthers" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name.  Or three you face annihilation.
Yeah.
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
Yeah... let me think about it.
Right on Brother Judge...
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Bullshit...
Later for that. I'm done either way...
All of the above, man...  And then some.
Good.
Late summer.
His journals, letters, maps, books...
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
Thank you.
Do you?
Yes, sir.
Who cared for your wounds?
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
Most certainly.  Arrange it.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Is that so?
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Cheraw Falls.
Where?
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
As you did at Fort Wilderness?
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
I stand corrected.
It's Mister Marion.
Thirteen years...
Balderdash!
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
You said bribery twice...
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
How many men have we seen die?
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
That bad?
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
Bite?
Yaay!
Yayyy!
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Yes.
I don't know.
Yes, but--
You'll see before long. Let's go.
You're telling me.
You keep saying that.
Whose burying ground?
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
I just said--
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
Louis, are you sure?
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
That boat is my livelihood!
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
You can't.  I can.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Can I trust you?
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
You're in league with Barbossa!
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
That he is.
What?  He never told me that.
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
That so?  I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
Only a little.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Agreed!
No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Aye!  Avast!
Is that so?
Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
A moment.
But --
Have you found Dr. Bright?
No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
No.
To be brutally honest with you, Susan, as long as the nanobot does to me what it did to that idiot O'Brien, I don't give a rat's ass about what happens after that.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
You're not rotting meat.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Nebbleman.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
The trunk.
Yeah, I do!
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
Okay.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
It already is.
No, something is really wrong... look!
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
You're the doctor.
No, no, I just feel wired!
What?  What's wrong?
What about it!
The head shrinker at the prison.
Where is it?
Let's go.
I remember I was trying to help...
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
And you have him?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Yes - Sing Sing.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
Why
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Well, I should say!
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
With me you can always do business.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Why not?
Is that so?
A what?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
No!
Thank you, sir.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
I didn't run away.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Nothing.
Staring at us?
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Sorry, boss
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
Hello, Joe.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Yes - the worm!
I beg your pardon?
Heavens! The man's insane!
Now the lady said you may go
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Well sir, I'll show you.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Yes sir.
Okay.
We're in Pleasantville?
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
I'm fine.
... It's a pretty short trip.
Hello Bill.
Bud brought it to me.
She's crying.
I was in a bowling-alley.
I don't want it to go away.
Oh yeah.
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
Lover's Lane!
Why not?
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Lucky guess.  Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
Okay, that's IT!!!
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Still doesn't make it right.
Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
No it isn't.
The other one?
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Get lost!
I don't think so.
So what's the point?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
They don't have that kind of potential.
Nothing?
No. She really liked you.
... Lover's Lane?
What's that like?
Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
Hunh?
That's right.
Ooomph?
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
... Hi.
I can't.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
I understand.
Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Yes, I'll be there.
Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
D&D Mattress Man.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
I don't know.
Why?
I don't know.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
-- what are you talking about, come on --
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
You have a girlfriend?
...yes...
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Really? Please?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
No you won't.
Do you know them.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Ok.
How long have you known her?
About six months.
No, no. I did.
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
...I don't know what you mean....
Have a good trip.
Thank you.
It's Barry.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
Ok. Where are you from originally?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
...what...?
Yeah.
What is this?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Just have you for one second, please.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Please don't do this to me.
......and this is confidential?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
It's ok, take your time.
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
That's that.
Mhm.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
Fine, thank you.
I'm sorry.
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
Where you goin?
You gotta give me some money.
Is this where you live?
I'm sorry.
What time are you gonna be there?
I won't.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
What's the problem?
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
Nothing.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
You ready?
It's fine.
I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!
Now give the signal.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Of course.
It's a formality; truly.
Yes?
Of course.
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
And my own.
Enough!
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rou!
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
I don't believe it!
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
Go on, child.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Of course.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
Very much.
Not you too
I wonder sometimes.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
The actor
Do you?
Yeah
There's no call for that language-
There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
How much?
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
You needn't use that language with me
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Uh-huh
Nonsense
Showing life
The great Spanish bullfighter
Jesus
This better be good
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
Oh Christ
I expected more from you.
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
What?
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
Craig is one syllable
Kinda.
Yeah, you're probably right.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
You're lying to me.
Yes
Again
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
Sure. What is it?
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
Yeah, I know.
When?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
What do you mean, "you"?
But you said "you."
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
What does that mean?
Oh, Jake.
No, I'm not.
Yeah, what?
I never noticed his face.
What're you talking about?
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
No, not that.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Jake, sit down for a minute.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Oh. When are they expected home?
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Not yet.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Who said I was getting rid of it?
You did.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
How?
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
People have different emotional levels that --
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
No.
Smart girl.
Only because it's expected of her.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Make the one you want.
For what?
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
Lisa! Shut up!
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
You mean "goodnight."
So do I.
What is it you're looking for?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
125 West Ninth Street.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
What doesn't?
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
The same.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
I'm glad they let you out.
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
How'd he get in?
You still want to go home, Moose?
Yeah!  Shh!
I better clean this up before she sees it.
Well--
You don't want me to go.
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Are you going down there?
Yes, sir.
No.  I don't think so--
What?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
No.  In the morning.
What's a chickie-run?
Yeah?
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Come on!
I've got a gun.
I know.  Light a match, will you?
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
My gun?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
I shot at one of them.
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Leave me alone.
Try the desk.
She eats him alive and he takes it.
What?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Yes, ma'am.
Dig the square wardrobe!
Oh.
I'm not so bad.
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
I'm numb.
I don't know.
You disappointed?
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
What's he like?
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Talk to them!  Heavens!
No.
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
We were romantic then too--
Are you and Mom home tonight?
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Hi.
What are you doing here?!
A man of some travels.
Please, Gabriel, don't...
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
You are to me.
One more. Smile. One more.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
They're truck drivers.
I don't know...
We'll need one.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
What are you talking about?
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Yes!
What's her middle name?
Christmas... Eve...
What the fuck are you talking about.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
...never... tried...
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
How'd you know my name...
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
Not with you.
You gotta get someone upstairs.
How do we do that?
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
I promise you, I didn't know!
Not yet.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
...be with her...
...for Christmas...
What? No...
Who the hell made this map.
Fine, now.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Bullshit.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
Yeah.
Me and Mr. White?
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
What? Snap out of it!
How is he?
Your name's Freddy something.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Joe.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Let's go in the other room...
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
Uh-uh, just cops.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
I got the diamonds.
Where? Are they out in the car?
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
No shit?
If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Not these guys.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
Where do you keep the can opener?
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
I suppose it is.
You should know. She's in your dream.
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
Why do you think?
All right -- it's said!
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Hurry up.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
Nice.
This is an awful nice gun.  Certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Yeah, it does.
There's only two of them now.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
What's there to be fair about?
What's botherin' you, anyway?
Don't act so -- crazy.
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
Then why stay in the hills.
Even women?
There aren't any women here.
Depends on how good you drive.
And we're running out of that.
What are you waiting for? Do something.
That's it then.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
I sure would.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
No.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Steve --
I think he wants me.
Alex, what are you doing?
Would you die already?!
Psychology.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Great!!!
Shit!
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Listen to me I --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
What, you think I did this to myself?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
I'll go.
No, my friends are right here!
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Are these all the subjects?
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
What is it, Dwight?
That's why we came here, remember?
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
What?
What she said about your mother?
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
What does it say?
Aww. Cool. Dude.
No!  It wasn't like gore movies at all!  IT WAS REAL!
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
Don't wake the kids...
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh, honey!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
I certainly was not!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Yeah - sure.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
You think my sister is there?
Can we go there now?
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
I'll give you a check.
She can only use cash.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
Hello, Frances.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
We could tell him.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
Why wait?
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Yes.
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
I understand.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
It seems right to us.
I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
I'll be out in a minute.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
Graham Dalton.
Yes.
No, I think you look... fine.
You play an instrument?
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Why is that?
Do you want me to?
Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
What?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Yes.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
I have money.
Yes.
Do you want me to stop?
I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
Yes.
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
No.
No.
And now you can?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
And you feel the same way with John?
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
I've told you.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Like maybe a big part?
I don't know.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
I don't care.
I want to know why you are the way you are!
I'm okay. It's okay.
You did that?
Mmmmm...
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Why?
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
You bitch. I knew it.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Radon leakage?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Yes.
What?
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
No, it's nothing like that.
Well, what, then?
No, but I did.
You touched him?
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
Then why do you keep asking about it?
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
And that's all?
That's all.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Prettier than Ann?
I'd like to make another tape.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
I'm intrigued.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Right.
I just... Ann is very...
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
You trust him.
Who?
No.  You said three-fifty?
Will you lease month-to-month?
You were prying before?
She held up very well.
No.
Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Was he nice to you?
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Do I get a kiss?
Uh, OK. Sure.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
Nick, you're so strange...
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
No? How come?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
NIGHT NIGHT
Why Janet?
So it seems.
Who trusts experts?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
I don't want to get up there.
I know.
It's...
What show?
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
F for...
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
CRIMINAL
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
She walks in beauty...
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
And?
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
My condolences.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
Good. How're you?
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
What color is it supposed to be?
Now.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Pour us a couple.
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
Fuck you.
So what's the plan today?
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
Right now.
Yep.
Deep.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
With Maya.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Let's leave it alone.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
What's that?
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
No way. No way.
Yeah.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
Me?
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
Yeah.
You were wearing your belt.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Sure.
Good for you.
Try it.
Hey.
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Sure.
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
About two-thirty.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Yeah.
French or American?
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Don't touch him.
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
Hi baby.
Clear for what?
No I'm not.
You want him coming in the house next time?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
Ray Reddy's house.
They're right behind the door.
How do they know it's over?
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
Don't.
Yes.
Don't do it.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
I would say so.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.
There's nobody coming?
Did it seem short to you?
All right then.  Let's go.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Paden sends his best.
I already did that.
Yeah, maybe a bath.
I expect.
I've got a job.
What about the law?
Believe it.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
We wait.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
It's none of your business.
Why come to me?
Why would they stop you?
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
It is that.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
Good-bye, Paden.
You like a good saloon?
Who's the owner?
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
That was my plan.
I wouldn't worry about that.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Good-bye.
Excuse us.
The public decides who's on that list.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
-- It's called a projector.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Even the fall from the plane?
Simone does not control my destiny.
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
Really?
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Please put your clothes on
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
Don't be.  It was worth it.
I need flesh and --
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
How?
I do okay.  How about you?
Really?  Too bad.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
This is the story.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
-- I bet you have.
I'm keeping it in trust.
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Er,... good.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
Don't you?
I don't understand.
Yes.
I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
Good.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
You know what I'm talking about.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
You're a doctor. What kind?
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Know what?
Yeah. Sorry.
No gas... Hey, that's good.
Soon. One week.
Don't fail me.
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
I guess she did.
I definitely won't.
Oh.
Don't get mad.
Standing next to my window.
They?
Dead people.
Chuck E. who?
J. C. Penny's?
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Book of Jeremiah.
Hey. Fuck you.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
I don't think so.
-- It's not me!
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Down boy.
Who you callin' "boy?"
He's right. You were behind.
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Then why go back now?
So?
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
Second verse!
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
If...?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
What do you think?
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Would I lie to you?
He's after us again!
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Ummm?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
But you'll do it?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Another time.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Go.
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
Then don't.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
We're gone.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
Who's Fred?
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
You have a butler working that floor?
Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Mortal.
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
No, what did you say on the machine?
Without peer?
They what? What? No. No. Why?
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
You're finished.
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
I wouldn't go that far.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
You got clicks, anything?
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Wow.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Shoot.
Yeah... Sid?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
Like a mafucka.
What were you doin' here anyway?
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
What?
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
What else did Padiche say?
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
No, she won't.
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
How much sleep?
How long can you go without sleep?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Who are you trying to convince?
No.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
Yes.
I wasn't.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
It's something.
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I think so.
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
I'm glad.
Sartorius.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
I want you here.
You're lying.
I think they help.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
We want to talk freely.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Beg pardon?
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Urdu and Hindi.
No dog.
You asked.
They called here after you left...
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
Let's do it.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Mike...?
Absolutely.
Take my advice, don't buy any...
My ass is falling.  It is.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Get in bed.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
I think -- she's crazy.
I'll be right up.
What's the difference?
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
Even Joey Venza?!
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
I heard.
I asked for the man in charge...
I don't really see what that has to do with...
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?
How about dinner tonight?
She's taking singing lessons.
Shooting.
Take care, pal.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Let me see.
What, want a glass?
Nonot really.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
I got you a present.
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
Fine.
A spider.  Eight legs.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Some things you should say anyway.
Even if they're not clever.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
You should write that one down.
What's your problem?
I've got no problems.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
So you've found Thorkel?
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Peter-- my condolences.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
How is he?
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
No!
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
I left a paper in my desk.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
I'll try. Thanks.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Roger.
I don't know anymore.
In this barracks?
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
We're looking at it.
Which one of you is what?
Twenty-five.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Say, Schulz --
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
They'll shoot you, Animal!
You're teasing me again!
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
You'll fix me up!
It's not good for you, Animal.
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
You're crying, Animal.
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Why, sure!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
You want to go?
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
A little weak today.
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
Right.
Who did?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Not particularly.
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
And destroy every planet in the system.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
Agreed.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
One minute to warp core breach.
You're in the Nexus.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
Close to retirement?
You could say that.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
No, I didn't know that.
Make it so.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
Trilithium?
Tractor beam, aye!
Execute!
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
Scotty...?
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
David... Sorry I'm late.
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
Spock's burial robe.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Did your collaborator know?
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
I'll need it, Sulu.
With some on the planet...
Close... There --
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Torpedoes coming in -- !
Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.
Wait! Give me a chance --
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Yes, I was...
Of course...!
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Yes... But -- how...?
What I have done, I had to do.
Understood, my lord.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Success, my lord.
They know we would die first.
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
Sir, may I --
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
That's all you have to say?
I'm not a drama critic.
Say thank you.
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
How can you ask me that? Were we together? Where we going to be? You had your world and I had mine. I wanted him in mine, not chasing through the universe with his father.
Is that a poem?
I know, I know...
Ssssh!
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
He's on a build up to detonation!
Only half of you would get there.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
Spock?
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Yes, we've been through death and life together.
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Too late --
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Aye sir --
Steady as you go...
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Who?
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
Stop engines.
Trying, sir!
Battle stations.
Honors -- hup!
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
I exaggerated.
I would accept that as an axiom.
Humans make illogical decisions...
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
A moment alone, please.
What do you mean?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
-- That's the general idea.
That's crazy!
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Cramps.
Come on, Pavel...
... Best shot...?
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
My name?
Go ahead. Stun me.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
Iowa.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
It's his way.
I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
What's what?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Noon tomorrow...?!
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Explain.
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
Yes.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Mr. Sulu?
How long, Scotty?
Full power, sir.
The explosive override -- ?
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii.  Yes, this must be true. You talk funny.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
There are days.
A perfect moment?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
I am better.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Bye.
The artificial lifeform was right?
If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
Are they in any danger?
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
May I talk to you alone?
Thank-you for reminding me.
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
That's your expert opinion?
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to...
Make it so.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Can you beam him off?
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
... I believe you...
I never kissed you with a beard before.
All ship functions are off-line.
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
Good hunting. Hayes out.
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
No.
Can you configure it?
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
What?
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
Not yet.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
I can try.
'Fraid not.
We?
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
We've lost Bridge control!
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
You may need assistance, doctor...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
I wish I knew. Uhura?
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
Still think we're finished?
Spock's looking for us...
Now there's a poser.
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
They'll make it look like an accident...
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
Who else?
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Sir?
Sulu!
I was asked by my father to open neg-
Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
I am uncertain.
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work... the conspirators obviously intend to try again...
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
You having hearing problems, mister?
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
Nevertheless.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
Because you are dangerous.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
That was another time.
To new worlds...
Sorry, sir.
Aye, sir... This way.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
Of course, sit down.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Make it so.
You sick bastard!
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
What programs were accessed?
And that's exactly what he's going to do.

Captain!
On screen.
A coup d'etat?
Anything.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
You know I need to verify this.
I know.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
I know.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
They're holding position.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
Silence, Romulan!

I don't see anything.
No, we can handle this.
I don't think so... 
Have a nice trip.
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
No.
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
Which way do you want to go?
Gear shift.
Pancakes.
Minneapolis.
What are you doing?
My... husband.
Shit?
I...
Shit!
How will I do this one?...
No.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
What is hitchhike?
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
Go?
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
That was beautiful.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
We can.
Yes.
Many, many days and nights...
I must go.
Hey buddy... let her go...
In the cars, too?!
Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Get Fox.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Wait'll you see it.
I know, but...
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
You know that's impossible!
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Just not the eyes.
You're going down.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
Maybe.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
No.  Mace is in this.
Step into my office.
Shutup a second!
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
What stuff?
Okay... what about Strickland?
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
Only way I could stand your ties.
That's pretty much the way it happened.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Let's talk in the car.
No, you're just trying to get off.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
No idea.
No it doesn't.
Now you're really getting paranoid.
Something in your car...
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
See you downtown.
Yeah.  See you there.
Aw, Mom!
Besides that.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Hi there.
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
Winona.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
Yeah.
Smarter than us.
Do you think he singled you out?
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
I didn't use Low's name.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
The Academy, then CIIAC.
How long have you been downtown?
It explains a lot.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
You got a point there.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
Sex.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
He's called a couple times.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
That's true.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Suspect Zero.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
The little piggie speaks.
So you went underground?
Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.
Who told you about her?
You? You went by the book?
Yeah.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
Yes, sir.
Shit.
You've been through worse.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
Shut up.
Yeah.
What's that like?
Nikki.
Thank you, Nikki.
Tell me about it...
I thought I was going to die.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
How?
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
No matter what... like splitting aces.
Sorry?
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Why not?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
Hi, Mike?
Lorraine?
Are you on the other line?
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
You don't call.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Unless she comes back first.
There's the rub.
I didn't mention her once today.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
Oh.  Where is this place?
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Vegas!
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
That's not cool.
It doesn't matter...
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Always.
Yea, how much?
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
That was so demeaning...
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
You think so?
She likes you.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
What?
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...Shut up, Sue...
Sue!
...it's on.
Be smart about it.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
The Court gave you justice.
Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
Godfather.
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
Yeah.
Understood.
Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
No.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
And now, what do you choose to do?
Shhhhh.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
Thanks Tom.
Did he give you his politicians?
They're waiting to see my father.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
And what do you want for Christmas?
Just you.
I love you.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Huh?
I'm busy.
Don't ask me.
Tell me!
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
Be patient.
He talked to you?
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
Well, we ate everything without you.
I don't get it.
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Sure.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I met him in New York.
Marge! You've got to hear this!
Bird!
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
Relax.
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
Ha.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Oh God, I don't think so.
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
What are you doing?
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
What's going on?
I'll go.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Where's Dickie?
What does that mean?
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Hello Marge!
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
I told you! I knew it!
No glasses.
Golly. Who's paying for this?
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Randall.
I know.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Okay then, you're crazy.
Beating you away.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
It's okay.
Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
Do you want me to stick around?
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
You're such a liar...
No.
A few days ago.
31 people.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
My God!
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Thank you, Travis.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
With who?
No, why?
What taxi driver?
This I gotta see.
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
You said that?
And what happened?
For a fee.
Where.
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
What's your real name?
Iris.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
I... I don't get along with people like that.
Cops don't do nothin.
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
Age?
You moonlightin?
No, I want long shifts.
So I hear.
Yes, Sir.
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
Sure.
Slow.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill, you're too fucking= smart for field work." Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I= sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the= commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at= stake?  Oh Jesus...
Don't let him do that.
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
It's about time.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
I wish you were coming with me.
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
Well...
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
What did... what did I want to be?
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
Yeah...
I'm  fine.  Really.  
Nine hundred...
I don't smoke?
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Yes.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Well, son, you're home!
What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which.  Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right?
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
The Bijou?
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
Didn't you have any help?
Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
Dad, I...
Pete...
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
We live in a theater?
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
Who the hell is this "they?"
Exactly.
"Ashes To Ashes?"
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
No thanks.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
Some of it might come back to you.
Oh.
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
The war...
Yes.  Very.
Got any money?
Cathy?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
Yes.
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
Where are you from originally, Annie?
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Then why did she object to you?
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
That's up to you.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
Cathy!
Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods.  He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it?  I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
Just listen to them!
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
I don't know, honey.
It's Alice.
Yes?
And the white house?
The two kids?
Okay.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Well, you're the lawyer. 
Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Yes, Mother.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
I'm sorry, Mitch.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
What good will they do?
What?
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
Yes.
That's all right.
I'm awfully sorry.
Lovebirds.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
Aren't these lovebirds?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Are they moulting now?
But how... how do you know my name?
What are you? A policeman?
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
I'm sure.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
I wrote the letter.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Last night? What do you mean?
I'll get it.
Really? Tell me about it.
Of birds?
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Take wing!
We've got to get Cathy.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Have we still got power?
I have no idea.
How soon?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
What were the crows after at the school?
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
I'm not sure, but...
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
It is a pity.
I'm cold as ice.
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
Come in, boy -- come in.
I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
Not yet.
Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
No.
No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
I've drunk enough tonight.
I would make you rich.
I know --
"Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest."
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
You sent them. I had no choice.
Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
The scar.
How can you die if you're already dead?
He didn't kill her.
No. You don't.
So you're going to kill him?
I know the guy leaves a sign.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
You killed my daughter.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
That's what I came to see you about.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Of course, dear.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
No -- I'm afraid not.
I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
Is it real?
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
Who?
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
I was.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
Would you like to sell it?
Well, how do I know who you are?
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man!  It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked!
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
<u>Four</u> to go.
The meanest!
Star?...
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
What happens in tow and a half hours?
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
For what.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
We are...
Mom... please.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
What's that smell?
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
Not funny, Sam!
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
I'm Michael.
No... no, everything's different now...
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Take laddie.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
Huh?...
Let's load 'em.
I know.
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
So what's our problem?
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
What's it going to do, being a plant?
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
Probably the next meal.
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Then we'll never make it.
I think so.
Well, get to it.
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
What's that?
Extinguishers.
Little over two hours.
He's dead.
Just keep looking.
Everything that's been missing.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
MacReady...?
The journey is part of my work.
The Hall of Books.
No...
You know of them?
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Do you know which way?
The air... the power.
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
How do you control the Morlocks?
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Talk away, Professor.
All right, what is it now?
Holding you... again.
All right...
All right...
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
I live with it every minute of every day.
What is it?
You wouldn't believe me.
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
You're not from beyond the valley.
Why would you do that?
Yes.
You liked it there.
Learning was important?
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
Someone you loved very much.
Go back to your own time?
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
Might I ask why?
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
Sir --
He said he traveled for two months.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
My father has gone to a better place.
You'll tell me more tomorrow?
No, you're safe --
Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
How...how are you here?
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
How?
Sure.
Oh, yeah.
Jackie.
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
Yes.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I know.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
You think Lorenson kills you?
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
[Beat] I don't know.
It's Sunday.
[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
[Beat] I don't know.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
How...how do you know?
You told me this was how it happened.
I did?
You have nothing to fear, William.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
What for?
Is it true?
No.
Where are you going?
I'm not sure.
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Sure.
So you never knew your mother?
How?
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Hon?
You want anything special for dinner?
See ya.
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
In the leg.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Alright.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
That sounds nice.
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
I always knew that.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Who is it?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Why now, Jimmy?
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
How come he let you go?
Isn't this fun?
Maybe.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
West.  Left.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
So this is all my fault, is it.
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I don't know.  I won't be.
It's probably not a good idea.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Lemme see the map.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Yeah.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Whaddo we do?
Before.
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
What?
Sorry!
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Yeah, you want it?
Wide awake.  I don't remember ever feelin' this awake.  Everything looks different.  You know what I mean.  I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new.  Do you feel like that?  Like you've got something to look forward to?
We can change our names.
Does that mean suck my dick?
Yup.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
How long do you think that'll take?
What?!
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
What in the hell is that up there?
Then let's not get caught.
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
Grrrreat!
Yeah... sure did.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
Loser? You?
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
Whatever happened to Mary?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
Well... at least now you know.
Amen to that.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
Who?
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
It's right there on your golf bag.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
We will, but first I have a surprise.
That...? Vestibule.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
-- Love story of our time.
Nah, really, it was moronic.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Any idea where I might start looking?
Well, I know you're busy...
You want her dead, don't you?
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
Huh?
Three different guys?
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Fucking sickening.
I never said that.
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
No, it's an old football injury.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
You betcha!
You look great.
I agree there should be more.
Yeah?
Trying to be.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Really?
I wish.
She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Teddy, be brave.
I wasn't trying --
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
Uh-huh.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Huh...?
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
We've got bigger problems right now.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Cuba.
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
He was.
This is about Cuba.
Dean Rusk!
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I don't care. Cancel it.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
That may be what they want us to think.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
Oh, yeah -- right.
Sioux Indian, right?
It ain't Geronimo.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
Tell him, Ray.
How'd you know?
I got one up on ya.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
Let's see it.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
And get rid of the dog.
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Crow Horse, listen --
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Sorry.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
So they took care of Leo.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
How the hell do you know?
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
And on to a bigger one with you?
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
On his six.
You let me make a fool of myself.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
What are you talking about?
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
And now?
You don't have to do this.
Yesterday.
I like to play "reality".
How does it go?
And that's one!
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Sir?
ROGER, COUGAR.  Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
Saving them some paperwork.
Okay, okay.
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
Any more MiGs?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Tom Kazansky.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
Come on, relax...
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
Let's go. Eject.
They should have warned you about that one.
No. You can be mine!
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.
Goose is dead.
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Identification?
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
That's right.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Any news of Quaid?
On his way.
You tell me.
C'mon!
Let me buy you a drink.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
You know I do.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
Bye.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
I'm here at Rekall.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Doug, don't!
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
Don't be ridiculous.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
I'm not falling for it.
Get out!
Aliens built it.
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
What was I doing on Mars?!  Damn!
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
Cannon fuse.
Burt, can you hear me now?
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Has a lot of rain.
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Right.
Its tires are flat...
We got a plan!
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Not yet, not yet...
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Yeah, Val.
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
They're working together, too.
I know about Esparza.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Sustained.
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
I can describe it.
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Chinatown street gang.
We're taking the other case.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
About Chinatown. What went down.
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
It was self-defense.
See-cil.
See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
-- What trial?
That's right.
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
Yeah, we do some of that.
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
Get lost Bobby.
What was?
Out back in our morgue.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite- Able"... Here's the trailer now.
Oh.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
Tell me about the letter.
Take a look at this. Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail.
That would indicate that it's the future.
Sorry to hear it.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
Yes, he is like a clown.
You didn't do your homework?
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
He probably wanted to drive over.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Oh god, Laura.
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Call me.
But I love you, Laura.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
I'm so sorry, Laura.
Let's go all the way.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
When am I going to see you?
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.
Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Did you come home during the day last week?
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Nothing, I chickened out.
As if I didn't know.
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
How good's your intelligence?
We thought it was just.
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
Just as you are, Sir...
Neurology?
I'm on the staff of...
Huh!
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
You may step down.
...I was one of a group of...
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
When she...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
Yes... I... yes.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Yes.
...things change.
That's perfectly all right.
Listen to me, fella...
Why?
What Hotel are you staying at?
Yes.
If I don't 'grow up...'
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
No.
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...I know. I went...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
Thanks, Franky.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
I'm going to help her.
...I have to stand up for her...
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I'm going to get laid.
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
Yeah.
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
Me, too.
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
Hey, how about that!
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
It hit sideways and skidded in.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
How can you say that when you don't know him!
Like...ah...
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Would you like some coffee, General?
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
It's always been a good persuader.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
No biggie, really.
You get any sleep last night?
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
Like Freddy.
I'll be there in three hours.
No.
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
I know he is, sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
That's right.  So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
Coming for you...
Yeah...how'd you know?
When do you think it'll be done?
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
It's your job to know.  If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Like this!
I know enough.
I'm pissin' fire man.
Passport?
Maybe it's an air raid.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
It works?
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
Why are you here?
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
I don't have to listen to this.
You know what he is talking about here?
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
Long enough.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
They are much more than that, sir.
... Absolutely not.
I am accountable.
New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
Ready for another?
What's that?
Have now.
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Club Zanzibar.
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Thanks.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Set one up.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
But I am also with the government.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
That bastard Pucinski...
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
You ain't actin', mama.
What brand'd she smoke?
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
She got me an abortion...
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
Yeah, maybe...
You mean like pedal pushers?
Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
Come look at this.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
Uh huh.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
Sailor?
This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
I mean tomorrow.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
Lead the way.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Just tell me what you want.
Santos...
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
What?
Where we goin'?
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
By who?
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
Your wife.
You're stoned.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Kidnapped? By who?
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
So whose car is it?
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
You must be mistaken.
Bullshit.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Sure.
Stop calling me Vernon.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
With Emily?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
It's not bad.
It's colder in there.
That's really it.
Really?
Like the lady herself.
What are we going to do with...
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Blocked.
Hm.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
What kind of dancer?
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
Hm.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
Caps.
I heard.
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
Oh?
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
I'm your man.
Grady?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
This is important.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
I don't know. It might be...
A jockey? You mean, like --
I might have his number on campus.
It was a beautiful present.
You need a table.
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
When?
C'mon, Walter.
I'm just talking, man.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
How does it sound?
It's a bright sound.
That was terrific.
Were you watching me?
Well... not in the common way.
It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Fairy tales?
No.
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
I'm adjusting okay.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
They sound like finches.
Yes.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Reflect.
You have no feelings for your niece?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
I couldn't say.
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
A nap?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
Nothing.
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
I'm only asking questions.
What else?
Yeah, you.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
I thought you were a dyke.
You must hate it.
What about them?
I get that impression.
Why do you want to know?
Do you?
Yeah.
I molested little girls.
What did you do to them?
Yes! I want to know.
I'm sorry, Walter.
The percentages --
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
Are you serious?
Maybe you should be.
Just think about it.
What's your fucking problem?
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
How deep's the drop-off here?
Hey, you okay?
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Fine.  Be that way.
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
What about O-2?
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
I don't know, look around.
Calm down, Bud.
How?
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
Tell me later.
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
Let's go, guys.
Everything is.
Why bring it here?
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
As you wish.
No.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
And why did you drop them?
What! Get married?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
Tell me once more.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Do you consider that a compliment?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
But for what reason should I come there?
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
We'll try again.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Why don't you try?
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
No, not like this one.
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
No. The owners are in Australia.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
And how come you're up so early?
Yes, we will.
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
I would like to ask you something.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Agnes...
Who told you this?
Agnes...
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Why?
I just heard you.
Yes.
Where?
Down... there.
In the middle of all the pain?
Where'd it come from before that?
Anything?
No... do you?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
What things?
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Did your mother see angels often?
No.
No.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
Not my fault.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Sometimes, yes.
No...
How?
No I'm not.
Are you pretty?
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Did you know what was going to come out?
Why?
To be a mother?
I can't tell you that.
I'm afraid.
For me to get sick in.
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Why isn't anyone coming?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
Of course you do. Who was it?
Who?
She took the baby in her arms?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
Who are you?
I... I'm Martha, Mama.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
What business is it of yours..?
You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
How did she hide it during the day?
What man had access to her?
Obviously there was.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
And you weren't shocked?
And what happened?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
What is it?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Don't deny it!
I know you don't.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Long, thin and filtered.
Hand rolled.
Begin what?
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
She's been touched by God, yes.
Who is he?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
That's what I have to believe...
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
The cards... you're bank.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Read 'em!
I'll murder that Lennon.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
I beg your pardon?
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
I'll look in here again.
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Why selfish?
Pity.
Parading's better!
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
You're only right.
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
Lip reading.
Nothing good.
Hello.
Don't dramatise.
Yeah ... so what?
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Here, Pauly.
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
I think you're soft or something.
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Like what?
Can't he? He's done it, son!
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Oh yes.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Thanks.
You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
Don't start. Look.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Is that you, Roby?
Kill drive engines.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
I'll see what I can do.
Receiving.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Unknown.
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
And when will you be ready to do that?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
I kind of like it.
No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.  We're going to have to flush it out.
No, I don't want us separated.
You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
I'll come with you.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
Oh my God.
Does anybody know what happened?
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
Hey!  what about the film?
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Who knows?
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Any microorganisms?
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
We're coming!
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Let's be democratic.
Can we get to him?
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
Yeah...
No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken.
And?
Shit.  When?
I dunno.
How?
Where does that lead to?
How many... how many people are missing?
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Is that a fact.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
You should hit the sack, too.
You got it, cowboy.
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
Eddie what?
D-day.
Just like it.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
That's not true!
Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
Then you've heard too.
A happy coincidence.
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
Frankly, I don't remember.
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
This is Eve Harrington.
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go-
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Huh?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
Call me when you get in...
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
It won't play.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
So full of meaning, fire and music!
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Here we go...
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
I just wondered.
I don't have to. I want to.
I just asked a simple question.
Every day.
So am I.
You're quite a girl.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
No thanks, Birdie.
Oh, brother.
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
Probably not.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
Not at all.
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
Hollywood.
Karen.
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
The show must go on.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
- an understudy's performance.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me.  As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
I had no idea you knew each other.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Don't joke about such things.
Eve.
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Nothing...
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
I have no intention of having an accident!
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
Call, what call?
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
When's the audition?
Anything to help you out, Max.
All you got to do is name it.
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
I said I'm a dying man!
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
And I'm a Republican.
Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
--just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
--we gotta top the Times--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
If he self-destructed.
--'cause I only know four chords--
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
Morning or night?
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
Any idea what he did?
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Mind if I try?
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
By "they" you mean...?
But you know who did.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
--that was awhile ago--
--"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of Deserters."  I'm still waiting for it.
Absolutely--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
Hey, easy...
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
So tell me about the Times article.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
--this'll only take one second--
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
I don't know titles.
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
Look, I told you inside--
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Good God!
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
Howard--
--remember Toronto, Harry.
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
What the fuck is this?  You got someplace more important to be?
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Single malt?
Come on!  I won't tell.
You want onions?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
You can't sing at the competition.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Did you guys hook up or something?
Yeah, that's right.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
She's already on a plane back home.
Yeah, sure.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
I thought so.
Well...uh...
Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
It did.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Ready for what?
You've just inherited The Bible.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
Observe.
Shut the fuck up.
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Doing what?
Exactly.
Also like sex with my wife.
AHHHHHHH!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
What?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Are you okay?
Where?
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Well, they are French.
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Why isn't it doing anything!?
What?!
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Claude.
What do you mean, maniacs?
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Yes sir.
I was showing Sonya something . . .
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
Not you. Him.
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
No!
It's not you - it's the dress!
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
No! Well, yes, but
I'm glad you	did too.
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which	is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never	grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Please, if you'd just listen...
Remove him at once.
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Promise me she'll have her home.
Perhaps you could convince her?
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
What's your name?
All the good meetings are taken.
Alvy.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Wisconsin.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Fifteen years, yeah.
think that's, uh-
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
Yeah?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
Yeah.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
As Balzac said...
H'm?
Good? I was-
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
I have a tiny apartment.
No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Let's just do it, all right?
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
Well, I need grass and so do you.
You followed me!
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah?
Whatta you mean? Me?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Life. I said, "life."
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
Oh.
Yeah.
Is he in the bathroom?
Yeah?
Oh, I had the radio on.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Check it out.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
I'm cool.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Step up here!
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
I have a headache.
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."  Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?
Trigger.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Max, I've got a hit series.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
His wife has diabetes!
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
We're going to take them to the airport.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Yeah.
And here, you just-
I was very charming.
There were many men interested in you?
It has your ring.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
And you've only just met.
Who, Sally?
I have a small window of time.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
Didn't I say?
It's not going to come up.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
I love her too, Joe.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
Oh, very jealous.
And?
But she's alright.
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.
Give him a minute, Clair.
I love you, you're a genius.
You only made half your quote this year.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
We'll be fine.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Not.
We're great.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
I'm going to throw up.
It's alright.  Be our guests.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Otis!
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Okay.
Come on, Panes...
Yes, she is.
No.
Don't I find what?
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
I meant Sally.
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And you know, he really does not.
I will treasure this.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
I'm sorry.
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people...
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
You're not serious.
What?
Yes.
Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you see.
Do Peter Sellers again.
Would you, like, marry him?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
I wasn't finished.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Thanks.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
You weren't exactly horrified.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Invisible!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Wait, I hear something!
Stop fooling around in there.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
You held onto this all that time?
And do Princesses do improper things?
You did?
Mom!
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Outstanding.  Princess...?
Not that one.  Or that one.
No, sir!
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
What do I do?
My mother.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
It's a bet.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Sure.
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
So I see.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
How come?
I forgive you.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Of course not.
Why?
He and I are like this.  Sent me a Christmas card. See?
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
The mirror -- it's broken.
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
I don't understand --
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
I am. Let me get the cards.
A cemetery?
Too slow?
You are?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Who'd care?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Are you supposed to?
Oh.
A what?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You usually eat alone?
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Last night?
What for?
Think.
Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
What?
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
You left your wife?
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
I got kicked in the head, too.
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
Fran been sick or something?
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Mr. Sheldrake?
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Yeah.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Something like that.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Aren't you?
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
Well, I have things to do --
What's this -- you packing?
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
Who is Mickey?
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Not particularly.
I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
That's enough, Fran.
Fran --
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
Yeah --
Well --
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
I said I like all of them.
Sit down -- we'll talk about it.
No -- absolutely not --
Get out --
Tracks ?
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
Probably is.
How much is left?
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Who knows what's up there?
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
I never heard about that.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Do me a favor buddy, please.
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
Maybe.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Your daughter.
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
You know you're right.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
What are you doing?
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I had immense plans.
I was on threshold of great things.
Yes...
Yes, I know...
When?
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
What things?
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Well , who's in command here?
Beverly Hills --
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
168  CONTINUED:
Keep back.
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
Why?
It's exactly what you meant.
Come here...
That's my line.
So what's the problem?
A daughter in Oregon.
Send him down to her.  There's money in my duffel bag, back at his cabin.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.
Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel!  Here, this is for you.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Stay out of it.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Since forever.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
What do you care?
His name?
Sorry.
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
How ya doing?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Welcome.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
Dancing?
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
Here's the trouble with never.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
Go ahead.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
Were you asleep?
What a break...
I had to see you...
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Uh-huh...
All right, cut me a break.
No. No. Get Carol.
What are you trying to do to me?
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
So am I, Frank.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Okay by me.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Do it.
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
Well, I can't reach them.
Well, that's a load off.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
I'm going back with you.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
What?
Probably.
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks have they got here?  Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
One hour per man.
Yeah?
Yeah.
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
Ten million --
Because he is trying to retire me.
He wants to kill you?
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
Why?
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
They become complicated... messy.
That's fiction.
I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.
But he won't shoot you right then?
Okay.  Then what?
That's right.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
Except --
I told you, he will.
Ten years later, here you are again.
I think I got one today.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
They're worth less points.
So?
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Thank you.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Why?
Are you attracted to me?
Who was she?
She was taken.
Honestly?
I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
Shit.
Yes.  Please come in.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
It's a common question.
What are you thinking about?
What do other guys do?
Of course, senor.
Hey Doug, you want a beer?
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
No, better than me. You know, I have many friends, you should meet more of them.
Well, this place is too expensive so you've had it.
What's that? Free!
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
I thought that was part of the charm!
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.
You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
Nope.
We're going to need it all.
Who put a bee up your butt?
No, We aren't going to do it.
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
That bad?
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
Honza says they'll print an open letter to President Havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk-out.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
What do you want me to do?
I should have read the fine print.  I love you Holly, thanks.
Here!
No, by road?
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
Doug?
Turn around quick!
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
No!
We should be done by the weekend.
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
No way Doug, I can't.
Thanks.
There's nothing there for me.
Not this time, Kat.
And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
A champion of lost causes huh?
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
You will wish you hadn't.
It was the biggest I could find.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Just yesterday.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Yes, if you can get him free.
Some Americans?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
Me neither.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
You do --
-- This play means a lot to me.
So you agree you need help?
You want to tell me...
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
I heard what you did. Thank you.
Fun.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
I was twelve.
Sure.
Anything you want.
I don't want to come here anymore.
That's what I mean.
No.  Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself.  Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
Up to?
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
So talk to us about something.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
I thought she built it herself.
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
That's right. You just act like one.
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Yes, sir!
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Seventeen.
Uh, thanks...
Have we ever met before?
Good.
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Huh?
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
What's this all about?
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
Marty.
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
The Orpheum.
I run this place! 
Okay.
Yeah.
You expect me to believe that?
Okay.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Mmmmm.
Jack.
I don't know.
Nah, I got me a job.
Spanish.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
Yeah.
What?
Well, that's the point, stupid.
Yeah.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
How about over here?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Really?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Yes?
Okay, no monkey business then.
Hold it right there.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
The deuce you say.  That crate!
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Arachtoid.
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Who?
No, I don't.
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
I have a radio fix...
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Should we be on Code Red?
Where do you hail from, Doc?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
What. What don't I understand?
Hello.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me  lyin' and deceitful...
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
A week, eight, nine days 
He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
It's still a little early for me.
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected 
Well I...
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
Well what do I tell him?
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
Well, you just... sound a little
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Nope.
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
You're leaving?
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
I believe you  I KNOW you. But why should the police?
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay  that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing  although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town  but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Must be.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Physician, heal thyself.
Anyway.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
Only fry you once.
You two have some sick sex thing?
Were you drinking?
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Who?
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
Were you with him last night?
Did you go home with him?
I'd like to ask you some, too.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
To see if I can get away with it.
Everybody that I care about dies.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Yes I am.
Sometimes.
Nilsen?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
Why not?
If she's telling  you the truth.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
Fuck you, too Nick.
Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
On what basis?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
I don't know.
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Let's get out of here.
Of what?
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
Saddle River, New York!
Oh, I didn't know that.
Ignorant art?
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
You don't even work on your stuff!
We can do better. It needed more white.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Annina Nosei.
No.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
How do you know?
I need a dealer.
What?
SAMO.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Who's John Henry?
Come on in!
Can I walk you home?
Party girls? Can I call you?
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
You're your own baby.
What's that?
A present I picked up for you.
What's that about?
You only want one Big Mac?
It's three thousand dollars!
Sure. I'd be glad to.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
"Shreck's."  You --
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Didn't I say that?
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
What're you doing three dates from now?
Yawn.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
Dad!  Save yourself!
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
Actually, it's a lot like that.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
Eventually she married a young physician.
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Why, yes, actually.  Death and chance stole your parents.  But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates.  For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Yes?
Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
That, sir, does not compute.
I recognized the accent.
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
I hate being lectured.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
Surf's up.
I can make it.
I see you knew him.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
But soon...
I wouldn't bet on that.
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Like hell you do.
Hold it.  You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-
What say we turn up the heat?
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Perhaps the fall...
...A bat.
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
Recognition, of course.
Mystery.
Enigma.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
Wait. You can't go.
The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...
Nostrovia.
Slanta.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
That's usually my line.
Well, I met someone...
I'm not-
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
What?
Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
Can't tell if you don't say please.
What the hell is going on here?
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
I got family. ...Please.
You're a genius.
Miss.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Take me. Let the boy go.
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
Shouldn't we --
Well -- I think you might consider
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
Great.  Give me a grant.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Yeeees?
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
Did you really ask?
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
One.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
Right first time.
Isn't it?
Great news.
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Great, good.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
Yes?
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
This sucks.
No it wasn't!
Uh,...Oh yeah.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Yeah, we should party.
Heh heh. Thank God.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Uh... dill, um, face...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
Heh heh, thanks.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Deep and hard.
Agent Hurley...
Not now Bork.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Adam!
At least we won't have to worry about her.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
<u>Betelgeuse</u>!
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
I didn't --
What?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
Really.  I don't know.
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
No.  What's wrong?
We're...
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
We're practicing.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Are you a spirit too?
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
Just <u>say</u> it.
I'm lonely.
Stepmother's...
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
Delia will cook...
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
Otho, can you do it?
Any particular kind?
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
I don't know.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
An attorney?
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
Of course! By kid-lawyers!
That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
There's no need for a hospital.
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Hello, Eve.
Your leg must be getting better.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
How is Ben feeling?
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
That's very interesting, Eve.
I have nothing more to say.
Ben is very ill.
And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
... I see.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Yes. I am very hungry.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
A flower...
I want to tell Eve.
Yes.
Oh. Thank you.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
I see.
... Yes sir - elevator!
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
I'm going to work in the garden.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
How were you paid?
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Correct.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
Yes, I will.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
Try again.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
No, sir.
So...? Where the hell is it?
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Malkovich!
Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!
Just an idea I had.
Yeah. You want a beer?
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
You bastard.
You fell in love with her first.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
Let me try.
Let me try!
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
I said "yes."
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
Is that true?
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
I'm right?
My tits?
What's he been in?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
Good morning, Lotte!
Says me. Do you dream often?
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
No you mustn't, my child.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
No, I didn't know that.
One hour.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Lotte called me.
Sleepy suddenly.
You've got to be kidding.
Then what do I do?
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Was a time I knew what was.
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
Yes sir
No, let her rest.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
But mama..
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
She likes this dress...
He's sleeping in the church.
You was friends.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
I run him off.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Who is she? Where she come from?
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
You got to get up from here, girl.
Make it the way I always do.
What do you think?
The Gundersons.
Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains.
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Heh-heh--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
Yes, heh--
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
I thought you might know, man.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Well--sure, I could do that--
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Well yeah...I know that.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
I want a child.
Theodore Herzel.
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Hey man--
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
It's your roll--
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Dude--
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Not exactly a lightweight.
Uh.
And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Who is this?
Yeah?
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Friends like these, huh Gary.
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Huh?
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
Well. . . yeah.
Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an eight.
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
Impressive.
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
I didn't know.
Minutes.
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
Took you long enough.
Sounds like a plan.
I don't like it.
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Thought you were dead.
Too bad you're out of it.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
You should've killed her, then.
She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
How can you be out here?
I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
But, he could've --
Cancer.
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
Then what is it?
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
--which she may have--
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
My eye, is there something in my eye?
What're you doing there?
Who?
Not the only things missing, Nick.
Oh, sorry, right.
That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
What?
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
Your body, your call.
I don't know. Nightmare.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
--no one'll ever know.
I can't.
--no, I think they're all in there.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
I don't know yet.
Turn the tapes back on.
Four in the morning?
--which'd be about ten bucks--
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
No.
What're you, nuts?
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Hey, hon'--this is what pays the rent and tuition.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
Gimme it!
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
Down there in the Park.
How's she going to know where to--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
No one ever comes here.
--turn the camera off--
Ah, Domini?
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
She's off her fucking rocker--
You <u>know</u> what we picked up in the woods--
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--thank you for calling--
Who <u>is</u> this??
Well I do...
What was that?
What'd he say?
Thanks.
In the trunk.
We don't seem to be communicating--
...Friday?
Lubbock?
See, I never knew that.
No.
No. It just made them feel better.
You're an idiot.
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
Of course.
Nobody knows you hired me?
Right. Sorry.
What.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
For what?
You shouldn't have taken the money...
What?
I've seen a few.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
The criminals are winning.
Yes.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Not yet.
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
Yes, but.
Can I feel 'em?
I wanted to see you.
Shit. You better tell me something.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
No way.
What do you want?
Lie down on the bed.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
No. please. I won't.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Whatiya mean?
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Come on Dorothy.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
No. it's not Don.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
No thanks. what does that mean?
Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Good, let's drink up.
Yes.
Terrible. boring.
What else is new?. right?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Yeah. Good bye.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Let's go.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
This is not my usual Friday night!
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
What did you see?
I'm sorry, I didn't.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Yes.
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
See ya tomorrow.
You want to go talk to him?
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Jeffrey!!
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
NO.
Go ahead!
Hey Jeff.
Good deal Dad.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George.
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Derek!
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
You're a fucking amateur!
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Good night.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Allo?
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
Just sell it, Derek.
Touche.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
Try the back bedroom.
Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now?
I did not.
Mexico.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
Un sapo?
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Keep them coming.
Yeah.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
I'm sorry, George.
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
Why are you smiling?
I like fire.
She did that before.
But this is...
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
Swear on my life.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
They're over at the booth.
I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out. Starting over.  Cheers.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
I understand. What's your question?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Third group.
My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
Let's try ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
So -- where do we start?
An inquiry into what?
Did I say it was a natural death?
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
I didn't hear it.
Why did you come by?
Thank you.
What did Mr. Marsh say?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
Why?
If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
Did he make your life miserable?
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Three fifteen.
I don't know.
Then you would have gotten your money?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
I'll have you out in a few hours.
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
Yes.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
What would?
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
Tonight we open new doors.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
No -- you're not.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
Really.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
It didn't get there from me.
SO!
Well, I can help.
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
No, I don't think so. I --
That's it!
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Did we want to?
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
She used to be so friendly.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
Not at all.
About a year and a half.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
Much.
She starts sniffing me.
Then what happened?
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
What?
What made you ask such a question?
I already apologized.
How about if I set the table?
What?
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
I had a temper.
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
TO HELL WITH YOU!
But now that you have it -
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
It's only four days.
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
Yes, they are.
WHAT!
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Where we'll always be...
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
How do you know?
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Lucky thing.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
Patrick, he's...
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
Save him?  What are you talking about?
Moe's terms.
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
Evidence of what?
The same way you did before.
What are you talking about?
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
It was him.  I'm positive.
Caesar, maybe we should run --
The money?  The money's gone.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
What?
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
We're going to need some time.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
Yes, I understand.
Pretty good, sir.
I should be going.
No.
Hey, Mickey.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Caesar, you still got the money?
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Oh yeah.  Violet!
All right.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
Yeah.
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
No.
...  yes.
Tell me about it.
Almost five years.
Five years is a long time.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
I'm not afraid of anything.
We're not that different, Corky.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
What you heard wasn't sex.
Is that what you think?
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
...  shit.
Yeah.
Yeah, twice.
He does it right in front of him.
What did Gino drink?
Trust me, Violet.
If he does ...
I think we're going to find out.
How'd it go?
I think everything is okay.
You're asking me a direct question?
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
This doesn't go upstairs.
What do you want to do?
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
Treadstone?
I don't know.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
I don't think so.
That'll be their second worst mistake.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Look, maybe I should just...
Paris?
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
His brother.  You know his brother?
Thanks.
Excuse me?
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
I can't believe I slept.
I don't remember any of this.
I guess so.
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
Go back to the hotel.
What?
Get everyone down in the basement.
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
How did I get here?
I fixed it myself.
...Yer nostril?
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Layton.
In fact, killing people -
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Remember how they used to stick out?
SAM! What a surprise!
What?
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Out of kindness.
So what are you going to do about her?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
You're the only person I can trust.
Trust me.
I do. Goodbye. 
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
It's you ... it's you ...
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
It does doesn't it?
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
You're joking.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Stop it ... damn you!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Oh ... Jesus!
Take care.
Information Retrieval.
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Would you really, Sam?
Really.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. 
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
Not now ... please
I know, I know ...!
I ... uh ...
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
This is an emergency!
Who's that? 
No, sir.
No need, sir
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
What do they want you or?
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
She say she in great pain.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Where is she?
She asked me to pick her up.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
You're going to live.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
What's his name?
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
I know him. That's Noel.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
At least he's got people around him.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
No.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
How is she?
You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
Not as good as Nino's.
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
No, no.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. 
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
I need a drink, that's all.
That's too many.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Look out!
No shit.
What?
Yeah, you're right.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
Oh, stop it.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
And the rule was...
What's wrong with it?
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
No.  Don't worry about it.
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
Why?
Which would you prefer?
Ravenous homosexual.
Good night.
Call if you get weird.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Good.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
No.
I have to be somewhere.
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
Yes.
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
I'm gonna go look at it again.
Outside?
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Almost immediately.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Yes.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
Yes.
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Right there, Bobbie.
How do I get out of here?
Follow me.
No...no.
Nobody else had it.
Anchor?
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
I'll speak to you.
Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
It's not.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Yes, sure.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
What do you mean clean?
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
I'll be the judge of that.
Well, what is it?
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
That's yes?
I got promoted for things like that.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
...that way we have someplace to go when we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
You're breaking my concentration!
I'll pose any way you want.
Righto.
Are you ready?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Would you let me make...a statue of you?
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
Not only that, he copied us!
I know, man.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
What is it, your laundry?
Well it sure looks dead enough.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
No...look I'm busy...
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
You can cut the crap.
You're like an undercover guy!
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Suit yourself.
Hiya Maxwell.
What do you get?
Your work, the layers of irony.
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
OK Mrs. Swicker.
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Suck!
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
The sun!  It burns!  It burns!
Get away from here.
Down there.
What's playing there?
My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
You weren't home.  Like always.
You guys are thrashed.
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
Come again?
I'm going to the senior dance.
Pretty shallow of you.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
) What do you think?
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Oh my God you're having an affair.
Why?
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
China.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Why do you keep saying that?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Who we gonna beat?
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Oh, fuck you!
Five.
Watchers?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Vampires of the world, beware.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
That's the plan.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
Sorry.
Really?
Swear to God.
Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
You are much more.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Catch?
My right nostril?
There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.
Get over here.
I know what it is.
Oh--won't YOU come in?
That's better.  Got the radar ready?
I'll learn.  C'mon--
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
Yep.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
He' s confused--
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
And now you wanta teach me?
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
Annie, I think you should leave.
You okay?
Who?
What's so great about baseball?
Yeah...you a witch?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
I thought I was--
But he ain't seen my heat--
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
I won't have to.
What?
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
What do I gotta do?
Yep.  So how's Annie?
You fuck!
Why am I a fuck?
You're a great catcher.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
And where can I go?
Love to--
Ain't he warning up?
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
Okay...
...he did what he was told.
It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Oh, good.
Hold on a second.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
702 472 1862.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
I can't! I'm tied!
I don't know.
Ohhh...
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Honey, come here.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Hey, Rich.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Yeah.
You lost your control.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
It's none of my business?
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
What are you -
Back -
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Sammy.
Nick?
Well...
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
What can I do?
...position...
...and she doesn't always -
It's always been our policy -
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Call security.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Who's this?
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
Yeah, I know all that.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Why do you need that much?
Yeah, how do I know?
You can't make me stop caring...
What? What?!
Okay, okay.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Listen...
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
Yeah.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
And where'd you go?
What'd you have?
Oh...
Fuck you.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
Get - get up!
I am not!
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
No.
Ye-yeah.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Hi. Good.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
Sam?
Please.
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Here we go!
Nicky, I did -
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
It's in all the papers.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
I'll be right out.
All right.
Yeah.
Want me to take this for you? 
Okay, Sammy.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
All right?
Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Yeah.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Yes, you did.
What about my money?
All right. Be careful.
Okay, yeah.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Get lost?
That's right.
You're driving me nuts!
They checked in alone.
Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Hold it, hold it. Here.
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
Hey. This is Shelly.
So are we.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
Go fuck yourself.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
What little boy doesn't?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
Absolutely.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
You've seen me...
I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
Spear.
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Where do you think you're going?
This is one way.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
Not this minute.
That's your "rep."
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
What am I supposed to do?
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
Will you let me explain!
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
What about the others?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
Tell me what she looks like.
How much time do you have left on it?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
Pictures.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
No.
She's gone --
The City National on San Vincente.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
You could've hit me.
Stop talking like that!
They did some great job of reforming you.
Why are we stopping?
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
We can be there.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I still don't see you.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
Take the 405 south.
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
I thought so.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
See what, Dil?
Now, that was a look.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
He wants to know do I mean that.
Nothing.
How'd you guess?
Don't know. Who is she?
He's Scottish, Col.
Must be.
How special?
Must be in love to manage that.
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
Tell me about him.
Shouldn't I go?
Yes...
I'm superstitious. Drink.
Tell him it hurt --
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
I'm not sure.
More than that.
What condition?
Died...
It was you...
I promise.
The Metro.
Yes. Say hello to Col --
Fergus.
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
I heard.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Suits you.
What do you mean?
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
And what if you don't?
I told him.
You sure about that?
And who is she?
Just a girl.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
Yeah.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Am I?
I can smell her perfume.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
So I've noticed.
What is it now?
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
No, what's the funny thing?
Don't you think of it, fucker.
She's a friend of mine
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
Depends on what you believe in.
It's as simple as that?
Don't know her.
If they kill me --
No.
What?
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
People. They could be looking.
Nice lady.
He's a good soldier, Jude.
He believes in the future --
That true, Fergus? You in love?
Where are you, ol' buddy?
Oh!
It's all right -- look.
Why do you think I brought you here?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Why?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
Agent.
May I have a sandwich, please?
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Oh, I see.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
Next, please.
Bartholomew?
But you're -- divorced?
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
I'll take that.
Reggie?
Scobie?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Alexander.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Cutting it out.
I'll be right there.
No.
Why?
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
What's so illogical about that?
Hm?
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
I don't think I know that one.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Go on.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
Forty-five thousand.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix -- are they for sale now?
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
Leave?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Did you?
Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
No, Jean-Louis.
Oh. I guess.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
I don't know where to go.
Having a nervous breakdown.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
I wasn't --
What your husband was mixed up in.
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
On the street where you live.
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
Be careful, Peter.
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
Who invited you?
I never fucked Rod.
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
As fucking if.
Not my imports.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
I get the imports.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
You said that two weeks ago.
What's wrong?
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
She's underage.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
Really?
What are you doing here?
Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
Yes.
Why?
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Mark invited me to the party.
What party?
I can't right now.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
You heard about that?
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
Why?
They're not picking me up until six.
Sharon's far from a slut.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
Who is she?
You're not telling me something.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
...that is going to explode...
Since when does...
Since today.  New policy.
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
I need your truck.

Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
For cryin' out loud.
...truck.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
And if that Elvis shit...
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
You want cash?
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
That dog was mean before I met him.
It happens to this piece of shit...
 Excuse me...
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
Fine. 
Okay. 
Shut up.
Doesn't...

Okay!  All right!

...-cho and a hijack-...
...you.

...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Come on, old Pete.
God, man!
...Pete!  Come on.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
Come on.
...ho!
 ...shit!
Hey!
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
 Okay.  Okay. 
...yeah.
Taking it down the hill.
 All right.  Hey.
...did you?
...stole the truck.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
You know.
Robert Del Rio?
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Not completely, anyway.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...miles.
...man.

No. 

We're gonna die!
Yeah.
Come on, come on!
Go, go, go! 

What?
  I've got the real thing!
Whoo!
What the--?
 What's it say? 
What?
 Vitelli! Vitelli!
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
Thank you very much.
No.
That was quick.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
We do need your truck.

 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
...-lem too?

Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
Us.  Owe us. 
Exactly.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
And I changed the schedule.
...-lar.
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
Is this stool taken?
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
Went away? 
Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
...happen if I drop this?
Good to see you again, Leo.
I'll do it.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAY.
Check it out.
Check the immediate area.
...quick in and out.
Stay put.  Keep the camera trained on...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
They'll get a break tomorrow.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
You try anything, it goes in...
...-spite the mouth.
Him first.
It won't be long, gentlemen.




...it.
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
 ...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  I got it...
Oh, no?
EXT. DAM - DAY.
Get ready to take it out!
All right.  Enough. Look...
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
Uh-huh.
A man named Tim Ma-...
It could be a cover, I suppose.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
Doc!
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
Where are you now...
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
...tunnel!
Yeah.
Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.
Do you recognize this young man?
...-lem?
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
...hands!
 Pappas!  Move the car!
...there's a colonel...
...we're all gonna die in this...
...-damn phone.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
That's right.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
They're calling it an accident.
Who's the investigating officer?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Would you call him a capable man?
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
His girlfriend?
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
How did you find out?
Just find the girl.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
Haven't the faintest idea.
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
No thanks.
Tell her later.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Why?
Thank you...
The apple core club.
How are you, Lou?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Looking for someone.
No?
I don't.
What pictures?
Yeah?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
And why's that?
I guess not.
Give you three minutes.
A complete surprise?
Iced tea.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
What do you mean?
Oh... thank you.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Oh, yeah?
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
You sure shout that?
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Know him?
And Hollis knew about it?
Get in the car.
When was the last time?
Why?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Just... I have to.
And I want to know where.
It has to do with my father.
What does it look like?
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
What the hell is this all about?
Back to Mexico.
I have to go home and get my things.
He didn't wear bifocals.
He's in the dark room.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Oh no.
Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
He never even kids about it.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
I never was.
I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
So how are you, Morty?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
The L.A. River?
He did or he didn't?
He owned it.
What about?
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
Fifty lire... 
All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them! 
Why? What do you mean?
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
You were expecting her? Huh?  ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
So what's that got to do with it?
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
Go on!
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Yes.
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
There is no news big enough.
Charles.
You're no Venus de Milo.
Thanks.
A rooster?
You really don't know who I am?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Is that what you want to do?
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
Can you prove it isn't?
Yes, sir.
A wasted day.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Look out that window.
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
She was going to leave you anyway -
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
Yes.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
Maybe you could remember something that -
Rawlston is my boss.
I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -
He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -
Yes.
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
How do you do, Charles?
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
Millions - if anybody wants it.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
What about that apartment?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
Can I join in?
So where is he?
He went home to change for the big date.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
Dante. You've got a customer.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
Look how full of yourself you are.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
You mean, on a date?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
Um... okay.
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
Lenin's Tomb.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Why are the shutters closed?
What do you two fight about?
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
That's frightening.
You think things would be any different now?
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
What about Veronica?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
Yeah.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
I think they were Catholics.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
You know what pisses me off the most?
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
Bible truth.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Balls resting on his lips.
Listen to you.
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
I want to rent a movie.
You work in a video store!
If you must.
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
Please, get the hell out of here.
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
You're happy?
I'm happy.
You're kidding.
Could be.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
Thirty-seven.
I was born.
I should shit or get off the pot.
What are you talking about?
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
To say the least.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Yes.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
Yeah?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
With you? I don't think so.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
You used to go out with her?
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
You're kidding.
Hunhh? Nothing.
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Really?
I was kidding.
How many what?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
It better be up to and including me.
Twelve.
Including you; yes.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Why do you say that?
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Please calm down.
How many?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Um. Thirty-seven.
No, but you sucked enough dick!
A few?
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
It was only a few times...
Would you let me explain...
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
Veronica, I love you...
What's this?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
He's your cousin?
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
I like the way you think.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
I will. Take it easy.
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
Rooster!  Forget the hen stuff. Be safe, honey.  Over.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Hey, fuck you.
The clip's not gonna hold!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Give him the money.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
I don't expect you to understand.
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Jess--you look good.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
He can handle it.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Call me sentimental.
You attacked me.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Next time, date only basketball players.
Get it!
This rope is sixty years old!
Never, what?!
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
"Time is money" -- please.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
Forget it!  I refuse!
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
There.  You blind?
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
Who are they, sir?
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Do you feel that way now?
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Surprise?
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
No, sir.
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
I just say what the other person would say?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Yes!!!
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
What?
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Did better'n that.
Oh, my, yes.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
The crowd had to dig it.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
I'm sorry.
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
I never bought that.
Elvis?
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Tell me about it.
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
I got caught up at work.
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
I was just tryin' to...to...
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Max?  I'm Vincent.
No.  You say you're cool.
Yeah.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
I'm trying...
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
I think so.
South Central.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Why?
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I need the job.
What you mean, no?
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
There you go...!
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Excuse me?
Geronimo?
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Not for years.
You think I'm crazy.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
Love.
You saved my life.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Them who?
I noticed.
Surprise me.
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
I've been reading up on it.
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Who are you, Jerry?
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
So what's the question?
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Murdered?
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
What?
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Back where?
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
What about you?
<u>Liza</u>!
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
You're here because you figured I might show up.
I'm leaning toward no.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
Excuse me?
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
I don't believe you.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Agent Lowry?
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
What do you suggest?
What?
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
No doubt.
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
Ellie.
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
But what do I say?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Now... you go home.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
No more stalling, Captain.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
A page-break signal.  A period.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
-- of Hadden Industries.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started...
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Peter.
It's really happening.
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
Can you try?
Do you love your parents?
I don't think so.
It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
It's getting late...
Oh.  I brought you something.
What?
What are you so afraid of?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
They don't believe me.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
Ram it in and break it off!
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
Hey, Tattoo!
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
Look, she's got paint on her toenails! Oh Lord, whatever I done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. Oh you Lucille!
'Bout two hours left.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
What you mean, Luke?
Luke. Where you goin?
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
He was lying.
You get me out first.
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
Would you want to work with us on this?
That's no surprise.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in my head...
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
Who came in after you?
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
How about I put Nikko on it?
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
You messed with the evidence.
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
What!? They brought the car here?
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
You're not envious?
So - why the airport?
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
You could get your wish at any moment.
I did this already.
Yeah, and a dimple.
I don't think you understand.    I won't wait.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
But everything's OK?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
You're slowing.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
It's good exercise, Mom.
Yeah?
I guess so. I think that's right.
No.
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Very romantic setting.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I wish I could have seen that.
No way.
Tell the doctor.
Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
I'll see you tonight.
You got wine. That's great.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
I think I should go home.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
How about a dance?
It wasn't exactly a lie.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Yeah, the plans.
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
Yeah.
Yes.
Sure. Why?
I hope it wasn't something I did.
This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
I'm glad you're doing well.
What does that mean?
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
They left about a half hour ago.
I dunno.
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
You're calling me on is phone?
You don't trust me?
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Good word.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
I only have your word for that.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
Where are you staying?
No problem.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
You're sure?
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
Does it really matter what I say?
What do you want now?
I've got a way with people.
I'm from Belgium.
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Everything.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
What room number?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
I'm the driver.
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
Get in the car.
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
The hell it is.
What?
Where is it, Sophie?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
Glenmorangie.
Glenmorangie is very good.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
No.
Sounds boring.
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Why were you spying on the Yus?
What's it to you?
And if I use them to kill you?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
Shut up!
I owe you nothing.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
You don't seem to understand.
So what if I don't?
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
Do you know her?
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
You're too young to understand.
Really?
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
How so?
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
Only the sword will settle this.
Kneel!
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
Give it back!
My comb!
It is trouble for me.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Perhaps.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
But Wudan does not accept women.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
I'll look around and catch up later.
We followed Jade Fox.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
But the sword could be in his compound.
Annie, I need a file.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
In a better place.  I hope.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
You don't even remember...
Wrong answer.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Does it hurt?
You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Who got himself what?
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Excuse me?
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
On my mother's life.
Why not?
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
It's not really important.
Give me the fucking letter.
You implied it.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
I said I was sorry.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Doing what?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
I'm... I'm alright.
Reading.
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
Oh please.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I do.
Because I'm in love with you.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
I have feelings for you.
Where are you going?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Why aren't you understanding?
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Well... not exactly.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
Just taking your photo.
And then I can go home?
But -
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
I know.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Same time next week?
You do?
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Good luck, Sebastian.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
She bought it.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
Yeah?
No.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
What?
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
I'll think about it...
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Okay.
What's your plan of attack?
Yippy.
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
She shot you down.
Where is she?
Annette?
What about her?
Black.
I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
She really loves me.
You bastard!
I'd love to.
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
Yes, darling.
All right, mommy.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
Amy's been lying again.
It's your play.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I live right here.
Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
But you must!
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
My dolls. We can pretend.
That's a fine-looking ring.
Soon as I finish.
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
Who is she?
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
Good.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
Don't you hear it?
Yes, yes -
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
Go on -- out with you.
Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
No, it was another woman.
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
It's not just in my head.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
What does that have to do with me?
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
I haven't gotten it yet.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Okay, I gotta go.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see "American Werewolf in London?"
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
Uh huh. So pee.
Since when do you care?
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Did you change your hair?
A little.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
No?
No, she died when I was twelve.
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
Okay, you busted me.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
What? Is there someone else?
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
Peter I love you too but...
Worse than this?
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
Oh my god, what happened?
No, it was our first date.
No, take it.
She's just so... pathetic.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Take some allergy medicine.
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
And you think I'm sick?
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Spinning backwards?
He's seriously disturbed...
Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Shut-up.
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
Where does it lead?
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Yeah.
Exactly. A condition.
What do you mean, he's clean?
Oh.  Fine.
I don't think so.
Bob...
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Oh, yeah... probably...
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
He's not.
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
They re not my attack dogs.
Really?
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
I can't say.
Uh...
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
Oh... Yeah.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
Home.
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
What?
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
Gasparilla?
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
That sounds like a curse to me.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
Datura.
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
Maybe.
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
No, sir.
What'dya get?
Actually I don't
You know how many demerits we're talking?
Well, no shit, Sherlock
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
This is it.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
I'm not?
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
What good will that do?
I gotta find Chet.  Make yourself at home.
Knox!  what are you doing here?
Uh-huh.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Yes sir.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
YAWP!
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
I don't.
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Neil, you're not gonna...
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Then you better start swimming.
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
I told you...
I'm their ride.
Jesus Christ lady...
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Anti social?
Self sufficient...
Yeah you did...
How do you know that?
You don't take orders very well, do you?
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
Joey...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
That way.
I have been.
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Where is everybody?
Nothing.
What is it man?
Yeah.
What?
I'll get it! Where is it?
You're full of shit!
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
Who? Who is?
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Nick...
But you must come in.
You mean...?
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Now he's back.
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
Not so good.
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Linda, what's the matter?
Oh... You know...
Linda... Hey, Linda...
What?
Will you marry me?
I don't know.
But --
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
I don't know.
Playing.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Merle, I wanna go home!
I know.
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
Yeah.
Fucking A.
You're right... Okay, you're right.
LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
Great. That's great.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
You didn't get a deer?
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
I'd think about it.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Avon Lady!
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
Give it to me.
Out of the room.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
You're crazy.
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
I'm ready.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Not too good.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What's it mean?
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
Thank you, Belle --
I didn't.
It hasn't opened yet?
And what about Daniel Webster?
Why? It don't hurt.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Anybody can see that.
Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
But I like the new one better.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
She couldn't be gone!
Belle.
You are afraid!
-- of what happens after we die!
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
I do -- and I think you should too.
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
Not long -- now.
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
There's no joy in it for me.
Well, I --
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
That's what we said.
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
Oh -- Jabez.
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
I don't know, Jabez.
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
Wouldn't profit him none.
A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
I say -- it don't matter.
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Just someone from New Hampshire!
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
You mean -- a jury trial?
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
I can't be honest with them.
That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.
It's corny, but I could live with it.
See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
Who said we were terrorists?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
New York...
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
You did.  You murdered by Boss.  Now...  They're looking to me.  Personally I'd pass on the jab.  I don't enjoy being this close to you.
That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
What's it look like?  We're going in.
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Yessir.
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
Heidi, I'm dying.
Take the subway.  We need the car.  Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!
It's okay... it's okay...
Yeah.  It was terrible.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
You're really crazy.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
What?
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Shit...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
They won't talk to you.
Right.  See you sometime.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
Okay, give us the women.
Come on.  I want you to see something.
Well, armed, then.  Nobody's been hurt.  Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year.
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
We're bringing in your wife...
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
What if I take you with me?

What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
They look like good kids.
Sure - we like you.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
Hey.  It's raining.
No, that's all.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Let's go, Sonny.
Alive.
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Look, I talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter - they can't land on top of the roof - so they're comin' with a big ... limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport - and they're gonna get a jet ... so things are rollin' ... they're movin' ... I also ordered some food ... I got some pizzas for us, all right?  I got some things to drink - I got sodas ... I even asked them for aspirins ... I'm doin' what I can ... now I gotta pay for the pizza ... where are the marked bills?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Okay.
All right. 
Okay, when do I get them?
You follow my car. 
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
... Just give me time to think...
Yeah - it looks real official.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Robbing a bank.
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?

I don't know. They might be dead already.
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.

Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
You're welcome.
Gotta go.
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
Yo, I'm gone.
How are you holding up in this weather?
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
Don't worry about it.
It's a motherfucking shame.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
I would like to get paid now.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
Sal, I want my money.
Quit bullshitting.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
When?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Meda.  Meda.
What?
Later.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
I ain't getting shit.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
We don't know nuthin' else.
So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority.  I've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none.  This is America.  Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all?  Well, you don't.  I'm your father, you better remember that.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Very good. Back in a jiff.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Right.
Home school? What's that?
No no no no no.
No.
Me too!
Yeah, he's a pirate.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Where did you learn that word?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
HARRY! Here he comes.
Yes.
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
The answer is George Jefferson.
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
Well, I'm listening now.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Well, what should we do?
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Oh, go on.
That's it. I'm done.
Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
Have you got what I want?
Oh yeah, give it to me.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
The evidence of what?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Yes.
I'm sorry Gurney.
The Emperor's blade.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
Those sounds could be imitated.
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
No.  I never drink -- wine.
I predict we're lost.
Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andtruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Nah.  This happens all the time...
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Okay.  Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
Really?
But maybe not.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
No problem.  I know it by heart...
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
I guessed.
Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
Ed, it was only one review.
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
I don't know.  It's so much money...
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
That's right...
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
Hruphh...?
Raising money is tough.
From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
Okey-dokey.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
We're escaping!
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Are you a fruit?
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
How long's he been here?
Oh, hi.
No! I love sex with girls.
Oh.  Okay.
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
Well you tried --
Dynamite --
Huh?!
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
At what point?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
They celebrated the common person.
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
You know what would be great?
What?
You know it.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
A woman wants to be pursued.
Tell me.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Right.
Oh.
Yeah?
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
Could've been a nurse?
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
Mom?
So you had sex with him?
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
All right. Let them decide.
Our foibles, our foibles!
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
I batted!
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Really?
Oh God, this is so weird.
The what?
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Where were you?
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
What is?!
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Look, we gotta talk.
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
Hi.
The pirate ship.
Hi.
Sure.
Ed?
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
But you haven't written your novel.
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
Do it!
You guys have fun?
What?
You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
But, Mr. M. -
Ethics are...
You bet.
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
Hello, Tracy.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Plenty of pep, too.
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Hmm?
Okay, Jim. I understand.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
And 290 "disregards," right?
I'm not like you.
What?
So?
I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.
Thought what?
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Paul, get out!
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
Yes.  But do you know?
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
But you did it anyway.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
In the morning.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
Homicide?  A detective?
How'd you get them to retract?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
I'm not asking you.
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
No.
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
I got her address.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
Yeah, so...
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Nothing.
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
They shot him in his library.
Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
But you were business associates?
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
Not good enough.
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
How about White?
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
Some reality.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Do you have any proof?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
I like it!  I like it!
Something good?
Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
I'm telling you, I--
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Listen--
You're crazy.
Wait. What do I do?
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
No shit.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
One-twenty.
I called my wife!
You told me no calls.
Looks like Detroit.
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Where?
Here?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
Goddammit--
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
Reynolds.
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
You got any money?
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Very good.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
What do you mean?
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
No.
He's got his priorities?
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
What happened to your head?
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
It's over.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Here, you can use this.
You don't know who the fuck--
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
It is fish.
DePinto?
So you've said.
Why?
Who's doing this?
For the last four years.
You have to.
I've never met him?
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
I don't under--
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Mr. Dean--
Where've you been?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
No.
Usually they take clothes.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
The blender?
No, but they took my blender.
Serve the ball.
Bobby--
Bobby--
Yes.
I don't know!
You gotta--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
No, I--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Yeah?
Turn yourself in.
Are you still in Crystal City?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
Get it.
Am I to understand--
Hiding something?
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
He had help.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
No sir.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Which stall?
What do you mean, poetry?
Ask Al Auf. Almsy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
No, but I think I do.
I believe you still have my book.
Arabic?
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
Would you let me pass?
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
No.
A surprise, he said.
Don't talk.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Still a car.
There you have me.
What?
Sorry, what's your point?
Could I trouble you for some water?
Do you have your papers, sir?
Count Laszlo de Almsy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need ithard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
I don't know.
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
Who are his ghosts?
Please don't creep around this house.
I liberated it.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Right.
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you crazy?
Because I'm a nurse.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Thank you.  Thank you.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
- to her cooking.
You'd better be.
I'm not sewing anything else.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
No!
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I mean home.  India.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
Then come with me.
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
Only we have to go to work.
Why not?
I don't think so.
I'll come with you.
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
Or my wife's.
The windows don't open.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
We're getting close.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Are you...okay?
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
So what?
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
But--
Not funny.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
Where's my bag?
That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
We go underwater?
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
True enough.
Hmmm.
A dozen times.
Something like that.
You can't be too careful.
The Mask.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Transfer.
Right. The eight billion.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
There's always a surprise.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Charged.
They drive so recklessly there.
The disc is still in there.
You can do it.
No way.
Go!
Get out of here!
No, you can't.
What about you?
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
You mean the seven billion.
In the van.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
Black of course.
Remind me why.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.
To yourself, that's where.
I figured that out.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
All of them.
Which one?
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
And get someone to help around the house.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Course I did.
Lemme see it, will you?
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
Erin --
Erin --
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
They skipped that step.
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
So what are you thinking?
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
Gee, I wonder why.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
No one's taking anything --
I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
Why not?
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
You see your office?
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
The extortion, the threats ...
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
Did he say why?
Ross.
You come to the right place.
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
I'm gonna go live with George.
Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...
Come in, Admiral.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.
We've discussed this before.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
You know the Jedi Master?
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
We're in trouble!
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
Does Luke know?
Yes.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
You don't look angry.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Where?
It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
Never heard of that system.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
I'm sorry too.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
You are reckless!
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
What's in there?
I see a city in the clouds.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
If it must be.  Yes.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
It won't get through the blockade.
My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
I don't believe it.
They look pretty docile.
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
Give it.
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
Later.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Yeah, kinda.
Sewers. Come on.
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
...I saw nothing.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
Of Merlin?
I want to thank you.
Guenevere...
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
You freed it, son?
Ye...
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
I?
The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
To kill and be king, is that all?
They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Hiding?
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
Oh great, anything else?
Want to ask him?
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
She used those words?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Sure did.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
Could you see her?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Like what?
What else?
What's the difference?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
I found it.
The closet
Oh yeah, well let's both play.
Who's Captain Howdy?
Here I'll show you.
Cause I like it.
Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
St. Mike's.
Karras.
That's good.
I believe you.
Withering Heights.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Uh Huh.
In time.
Uoy era ohw.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
There's only one.
Her heart.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Sick priest, is that it?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Who?
Be silent!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Are you a relative?
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
How old are you?
Is there someone inside you?
It's our goddamn car!
Just the same.
How will he eat?
Two nights.
Fuck him.
I hate your kids, Frank.
You're their uncle.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
You gotta go.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
It never was.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?
Right.
Very realistic.
Last?
Okay.
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
How come I didn't hear anything?
You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me.
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
I can't make the tenth.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
What channels it on?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Shut up, Frank.
Who's weak now, big brother?
This'll kill 'em.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
Just call me a cab.
The flu.
Doctor's orders.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
Well, that's fine --
What do you mean?
You're an hour and a half late.
Where's my name?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
What's he talking about?
Do I look like I'm naked?
It's orange!
Nine!
You're a prince.
Right.
Did you hear it?
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Hey.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Uh ...
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Thanks.
Save it.  What's he look like?
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Nothing personal --
Every year.
Like a baby. You?
What'd I say?
How do you know?
Soap?
You're kidding.
Look, if you want to leave...
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Yeah.
If I see him.
Another five years, huh?
What happened to the donut king?
My days are not the old days, genius.
The recent past.
Yeah -- me.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
I'm not the same person you remember.
Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
And you wouldn't be.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
Whoever you are, don't call again.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
What more proof do you need?
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
Would it?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
You said it, Jon, not me.
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
It can't be.  It's impossible.
You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."
Shoot him!
Or what?  You'll have me fired?
What?
Trust me.  You're gonna love it ...
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
Just following your example.
Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  Congratulations.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
The hospital.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
You?  Married?
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Adelle?
I don't know.  Maybe...
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
I dont think youre hearing me.
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Thats right.  Okay, lets make a quick stop at the kids shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then Ill run into the linen store...
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
I think I could figure it out.
Big Eds.
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
Damn, you are the real thing...
Hey...
You just said everyone needs something.
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?
Okay, youre right, weve been dancing around this for years...
Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Thank you.
Howd you do this year, Tony?
Jack...dont even start...
Why not?
Shes your dog, Jack.
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
What? You make me hot...
Wait a minute.  Youre my wife?
Zeena...
How do you even know about this place?
But you always seem so certain.
Think bigger.
A perk for what?
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward...  Dont you see?  Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Jack...God, its been so long...You look...
Dont worry about it, Jack...
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
Jesus, Jack...
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. Youre a scotch man, single malt, not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
Of course I did.
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
If it's something you feel strongly about.
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
I'm worried about you.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
What do you mean "complete"?
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Not this again --
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Showtime.
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Front page?
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
What?  What do you mean you --
And reverse the mutations --
Of course.  Of course.
I gave him twenty.
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
The less time, the better.
How bad off is he?
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
You mean <I'm> going along?
Yes?
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
No, it requires such absolute precision --
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
The Breath of God...
No, there's no other way.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Then why not take it?
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
You have no right to blame Duval --
How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?
That makes two of us.
Looks simple to operate.
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Drop that fucking money!
Unghh... oh, geez...
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
No.
"No." First thing you've said in the last four hours. That's a, that's a fountain of conversation, man. That's a geyser. I mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man. Shit, I'm sittin' here driving, man, doin' all the driving, whole fuckin' way from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to, you know, tryin' to chat, keep our spirits up, fight the boredom of the road, and you can't say one fucking thing just in the way of conversation.
I need ...unguent.
Yeah.
Yah.
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
GOT IT?
Okay, real good, then.
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Oh, don't be silly.
Ya got that right.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh.
Yeah!
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Yah.
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
What... What is it all about?
Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Yah, how much money was that?
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Well... yah.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah.
You told me about it.
lot. It's a limited -
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
I'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry. Geez, what the heck're you?... Well, look, I don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal.  I assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently.
Well, they -
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care?
No, see -
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Uh-huh.
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah.
Oh, yah?
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
It's okay, Mike...
What'd he say?
Linda.
No.
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Copy.
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Was it reasonable?
Three-cent stamp.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
He's at -
We gotta protect Jean. These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em. So they call the shots.
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
We're still men.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
Really, what's that?
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
It means it was homemade.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
I want that.
In case we want to switch nights.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
Really?
Like testicular cancer?
Look, this is a bad time...
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
Worth every penny.
Please.
She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral in her book.
Here.
No.
Whatever.
Do you care?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Is this a trick?
We did make love?
I'm sorry, I...
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
Who's this?
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
Okay, everyone.
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
No, supply oxygen?
I don't follow...
Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
This is crazy.
Is it?
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Don't mention me.
A liposuction clinic.
No, I'm not...
It isn't... ?
Nothing.  Do what you like.
What is it?
What should I have told you?
You know what I mean.
Tyler...
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
... is over.
Wait a minute...
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
"Applicant?"
Why did you do that?
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
What about them?  They're lunatics.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
What about Marla?
Um, well... technically, no.
I can't let you...
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
What have you left for me?
What?
But, this is Project Mayhem.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
There is no money.
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Please, God, no...
I... I don't know...
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
Yeah, how?
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
Signs?
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
You were there?
Six duds in a row.
I have to save Eugene!
He probably already knows we're coming.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
Carter.
Blow me.
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
How do you know?
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Sure.
I guess so.
Nice try, kiddo.
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
Let us out!
No! No! Don't!
Why do you think I was hiding?
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
Huh?
What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
That's what I'm here for.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
There are no worse places.
I had it cupped.
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
You comin'?
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
Let's go.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Why me?
We just take pictures?
Don't look so disappointed.  It should be hairy enough... even for you.
Nice work.
Have fun.
Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
Word came down... they wanted an answer.  And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs.  But it had to look good.  Best effort.  The whole dog-and-pony show.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
That's it.  My life.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
Most men are.
Why this is outrageous!...
<u>What</u>!
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
And who's Lydia?
I... You're not going to understand this.
Thank you very much.
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE "AND" THE VOICE...or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT...
Lydia.  Lydia what?
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
<u>What</u>!?
I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
Parry... I'm Jack.
I know...
Funny -- you look married.
No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...  ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...                               
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
It's a classic.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
I'm still scared.
I know!
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
No just Parry.
You're married.
I leave it to you.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
Well, lemme play the other side then.
Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."
You're playing the other side.
I'm not.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm not some piece a crap.
You treat me like I was.
Now, hand...
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
Shut up! All of you!
Is what you?
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
I don't know.
What?
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
Very nice.
It's not that bad.
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
What would I do with it? Run amok?
Then after that?
I was really very moved by the way you...
Why?
I didn't have any.
None.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Yes.
What?
No, the last time was three years ago.
Thanks, Carl...
What?
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
At game, Carl.
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
It's a Borzoi.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
Don't call me "honey," mack.
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Why you have an attitude for?
Not now, I'm busy
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Wussup.
Nothin'.
What are you doin' here?
I, umm, came to see you.
So what's her name?
How you treat them?
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
Wussup, Victor.
You know, Eddie's cousin.
'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
You here to see somebody?
Positive.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Hey!
Jus' from around the way.
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
Comanche Indian.
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Wonder who his supplier is.
Nineteen.
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
You're lucky.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Not a prayer.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Yes.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
You find the source?
Can I get you something?
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
You may be right.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
I'd have been long gone.
Harry S. Truman?
My parents were great fans of the former President.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Where are you going?
You sure did.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
No problem.
They busted me last week.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Because we can't.
I'm all ears.
That's right.
What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
You doing a story on this guy?
Yeah.
Cute thing.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
How long have they been married?
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
Preoccupied with what?
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
I have this effect on lots of women.
No. He was. I got him out.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
What are you talking about?
How do you know about that?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
I checked. There was no divorce.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I want to hear this.
I would, actually.
Who are you?
Moved out.
She moved out?
So you're saying she moved out.
This morning.
I'm her cousin.
Uh, almost.
...never reads the paper...
Practically.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
I want something I can print!
But I ain't got you...
I ain't -- got -- you.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
I don't know, I never met your father.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
Exactly.
Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
Spooky.  I'll process her.
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Ye-ah.
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
The point?
Let me go out like a man.
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
That's funny, you're cute.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Where do you want it?
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
He is not wrong.
Willie Mays.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Not a chance.
Whip it out.
Give who a tail?
Yeah.
We put him to bed for the night.
Yeah.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Elvis has left the building.
The usual.
Did he?
Hello, Frank.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
I'm right here behind you...
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
What?
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
What?
Nah, I gave it up.
I never knew you, Dad.
Why?
October 12, 1969.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Something happened, something...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
October 22, 1969.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
You really wanna know?
No.
He took your wallet?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
We got him!  Dad you got him!
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Yeah.  That's it.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
Cool it, Andy.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
What?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
Yes.
Stop the car!  Now!!
Don't say any more.
I have to.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
What's it to ya?
I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
No more.
I found it outside.
Who ya calling?
Boy scouting.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Good night, beautiful.
Get up!
Tell me.
That's all right.  I was just...
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Randy, c'mon!
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
Really?
What are you going to do?
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Hear what?
The fire alarm...
This is Jason's fault!
They're out of town.
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
I gathered that.
I...I don't know...
We changed our minds.
What about you?
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
I don't want to hear about it.
It's over, finished and done with.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Do not inhale.
Tonight. What's tonight?
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
I think we Nought to wait.
I'm not ready.
Where is it?
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
It's your best play, Nicky.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
Had to be him.
Unbelievable.
This is how we've managed to last.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Do you want to get some coffee?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Opening night?
Everything.
What's sexy?
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
And you've been extremely patient.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
Let's not start that again.
Where's your elastic brace?
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
Show him who we are.
A grandmother. God bless you.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
How come?
When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
Yes.
So does Elliot.
I hear good things about the new play.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
I'm going home to my machine.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
One more.
Some of it good, I hope.
Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
I dined at the prison.
Somehow I expected not.
What a pity.
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
What are you talking about?
In a corridor.
Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
In case you get back before I do.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
Where?
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
No way. I've got to get out now.
Small town, small bank, big money.
Where did you get them developed?
Just the way I remembered.
It's all right.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
You were asleep.
I couldn't have... much longer.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
Bullshit.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
There are three men dead.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Do it my way.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
Fifteen minutes.
Not now.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
You want to try with me?
Things can't get much worse can they?
Oh, Jesus... how?
I don't know.
Pull over.
I guess we are.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
You were with him?
What about you?
Two.
What do you have in mind?
Dillinger got killed.
Can't leave the desk.
Where we go in1?
That's what I want.
Two years.
I Just want to find a suitcase.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
Yes.
Nothing. What could I do?
Yes. I told him.
This is my brother's car.
Was the steering faulty?
Never mind.
Why?
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
Nicer than most.
It's the truth.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
No. I didn't know that.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
What kind of entertaining?
Not entirely. No.
You sure about that?
Did my brother Frank find out?
Have another?
What?
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
At the Half Moon.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Don't know.
How'd you find me?
My brother, Frank.
It'll cost you.
No. Really, I am.
They came back?
What about Keith?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
How could I stay away?
Eric. Eric Paice.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Oh, you've been watching television.
You should have told me who you were working for.
Still got your sense of humour.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
But they have to be diplomatic.
Knock it off, Gerald.
That's right, Harry.
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
It's too...
You get a bad month, all of a...
Some contest board...
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
That's right?
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
He's doing very well.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
No.
They have...
That's what I'm saying.  We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff.
How do you know he'd buy them?
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Hey.
What did you say?
Have I said that?
Is that what I said?
He'd give me a job.
He would take you on.  Yes.
What?
What?  What?  The leads.
You have to steal the leads tonight?
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
I do?
What do you care...?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
They stole...
Yes.  The cops.  No.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Excuse me...
Did they get my contracts?
Shelly, you blew the last...
Not lately it isn't.
...you talk to Murray...
Let me...
Yes.
Murray said...
Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
Murray said...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
I will close.
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
You want something off the B list?
The leads are coming.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
You robbed the office.
Call up the bank.  I called them.
John: John:...my daughter...
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Yes.
Home cooking...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Oh, God...Oh, God...  Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express.  His family owns 32 per...Over the past years I've sold him...I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight.  I have to go.  You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go. 
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Yes.
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
Yest...
No, Jim.
I can't regotiate.
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Why not?
They took 'em...
Your farewell to the troops?
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
It went down.  I filed it.
You did?
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Do you like them?
No, where is it?
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
I'm not hungry.
What position did you occupy?
 Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!
How are the kids?
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
Because I need MONEY!
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
You would risk your life for strangers?
I'm not afraid of his words.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
He's an Italian?
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Yes.
Will you tell him?
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
I took care of it.
Alright.
I don't know.
I want it met.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
They are everywhere!
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Twenty-five this time.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Yeah, it was once.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
Right here.
However I can help you...
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
The money was sent.
How is his health?
That is a complete falsehood.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Trust me; do as I ask.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
Eh...  Five dollars more.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
It still hurt.  A lot.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Why?
You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you?
He is dead now, twenty years.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You and he are not doing things?
Broke is more like it.
Football in college.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
It's new.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Can't today.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
You first.
Oh no.  I never swim.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
You asked me to model.  Remember?
I want -- I want...
If that's okay?
Nothing would please me more.
David produced her last picture.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
But you said --
I'm very sorry.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Have a drink?
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Then the rumors are true?
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Tell me about Kip -
The business has changed...
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
Yes ... Kip ...
I knew you'd say that, too --
One more night --
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
Get out of here, then. Now.
No...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
What are you doing back?
He's in some trouble ...
Mother -- !
You remember that, Kip?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
Yeah ...
I can see that -
He's gonna kill you -- !
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
"Shadow games?"
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
Sure, man --
Run it...
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
Call 'em here -- ?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
I understand -
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
No way ...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
Of course. Hi, Junie --
What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.
What happened to Sway?
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Excuse me --
Why don't you leave him alone?
What?
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
Liar!
I'm in construction.
Shit.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
With what?
What did he say, exactly?
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Yeah.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
Yeah, yeah.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
That's important.
Fuck you.
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
No one. I didn't have the number.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
You don't know that.
No, I had to talk him down.
Good.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
I have about seventy-three...
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
And what do you see?
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
That's enough.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Good to see you.
I got your card.
Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
Tom.
Why would he do that?
You moved?
I think so.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
--Gerry--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
He's not you!
Why there?
What's the point?
The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
You're getting defensive, Will.
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
You think so?
285.
No.
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
Well, are you going out again?
I don't know.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
You're kiddin' me.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
Yeah.
I didn't ask for this.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
It's not your fault.
I know.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
So you just want to use me and go?
No.
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Bullshit.
If you bring the caramels.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
Exactly.
They don't come over here that much.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
I guess so.
So, do you play the piano?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
What am I scared of?
What about your twelve brothers?
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Naw. They paroled me.
Oh.
I guess that's what he looked like.
How many men?
Four.
Two.
Kids?
Okay. House 63. Wages 5 cents a box. No bruised fruit. Move along and go to work right away.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
That cut you got?
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
I ain't gonna run.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
I dunno. Payin' five now.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Want to work, do you?
Sure do.
What's the matter? What's happened?
Yeah.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
No plants.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
Okay. I be back a little later.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
No'm.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
No--an' look what I got for you.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Since before they stopped us las' night.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
What's that--detour?
Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry. 
Won't they ketch us?
Well, there's plenty of work for you about forty miles north, this road just outside Pixley. Turn east on 32 and look for Hooper's ranch. Tell 'em Spencer sent you.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
You don't...
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's what I do.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
Insane.
Yes.
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
Bad experiences.
You met people.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
--She's not dead---
Yes.
Will you come with me?
You don't understand...
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
I work alone.
Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind.  I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
Hey, Bob.
Nope.
Wait a minute--
I love. I kill.
No...
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
That's wonderful, Mom.
His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
He sold me this bad boy.
Work's good for the soul.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
A jogger, huh?
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Son?
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Why?
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
Fine.
You were never thirteen, Mom.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
Don't they believe in signs here?
Did he mention it?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
Thanks, honey.
Did you go riding?
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
I should be in by two.
No, let me go.
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You're allergic to hay.
I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
May I have a suggestion?
Yeah, what?
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
We have a business manager. The best around.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
They fired you?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
- See, what you can do for him --...
It isn't right to make him suffer...
What?
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
I don't have all day.
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Sometimes.
What do you mean?
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Hackers of the World, Unite!
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
I want it.
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
I'm gonna hit you!
Yo, hit the lights.
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
And unpack.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
It nibbles. You see this?
We did it!
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Yeah.
I have to tell you something.
I didn't know what was on it.
How?
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
Gill.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
Okay sure. What about?
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
No, you don't understand.
Not without Jamie.
Look.
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
We should call the fire department.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Like a sister?
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
I thought you said you were ready.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
Well try dammit!
Then we'll be safe?
Why?
Just do it.
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
All right.
Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.
Jamie?
The state police won't know how to stop him.
You look sharp. You understand?
No problem, Sheriff.
Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
What's going on?
Now you understand?
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Don't touch him Jamie!
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
He shouts, too.
We just talked.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
The guys think I'm too smart.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Yeah.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
YEAH?
Yeah.
Lee Brackett.
It's important.
He isn't a man.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Is Annie around?
Same time, same place.
Sure.
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Let's make more popcorn.
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
And then, uh, April...huh?
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
What?
No, he called late last night.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Uh-huh.
Ed Smythe, yes.
I don't know exactly.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Where are you headed?
Well, sure.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
He's got like six gold records.
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
I don't know.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
I didn't say that.
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Absolutely.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
I can't keep my mind on the show.
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Like what?!  What?
But you don't have any symptoms!
You've outdone yourself.
Come on.
Why?
Yeah?
Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
He's fine.
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
I think so.
Thanks, thanks.
Go right over there.
Is there no chance?
What are you talking about?
True.
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
She really does, though.
Oh!
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Uh-huh.
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
What's the matter?
Oh, so loosely.
My--uh...
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
God!
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
...in a really horrible way.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Well...
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Nobody ever said it.
You're kidding me.
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Well, what about me?
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
I'm pregnant.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
...read it over, and think about it.
...<u>please</u>...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
And who is "they?"
That's right.
...these guy'll back you up.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
Yeah, so where is he?
Impossible.
You take this much time over everything?
Show me the Pigs.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
...here's to child abuse!
Yes, I did.
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
...what's he got against you?
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
I said sometime it gets so...
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Give it up.
I have had many excellent meals there.
Well, perhaps sometime we...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
How could you know?
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Where do you live?
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
And how did he do that?
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
<u>Yes</u>.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
...<u>what</u>...?
Fine, thank you, but
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
I know where he is.
What shape is the scar?
The shape of a Three.
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
I don't understand.
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
Ooh, I'll think of something, missy. A telescope?  Where you going?  I don't want to know.

You're all making me blush...
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
Why do you even like me?
Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love?
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
That's not what I was worried about.
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Shut the fuck--!

I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
All right.
Because you're an idiot.
Don't think.
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Color me nauseous.
Yeah, maybe.
Jealous much?
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
I don't really like your friends either.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Good plan.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
Next channel, darling.
Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?
French.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up...
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
You kids are making too much damn noise.
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
Answer him dick!
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Shut the fuck up, all right.
I guess.
May<u>be</u>.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
Sure. Ciao.
Look who I've found!
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
looks startled at the outburst.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
It's so beautiful!
You mean travel by ourselves?
That was what we were led to believe . . .
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
The way you just looked at me...
I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
Pitbull attacks.
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Ambrose. I know.
Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
What?
What?
Really? Why?
I only married you for your body.
No please make yourself at home.
Thanks.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Two.
I surrender...
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Well now there's a compliment.
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
You mean John Bubber?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
What about a reward for coming forward?
Said he's not an actor.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
Helluva story!
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Let's watch some TV.
What toys do you have?
Any particular brand?
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
Right.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
As long as you keep remembering why.
-- a sense of proportion.
A sense of proportion.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
Sure.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
You must value your independence.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
Uh huh.
Why are you mad at each other?
RUDOLF!
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
Did you hear what he said?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Well, what about <u>these</u>?  Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
Fuck you, Philip.
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
Philip!  The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
C'mon.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Two -- three if you count the husband.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
And I can't help having a cold.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Yes.
No.  I don't scare easy.
Around.
No.
Caution shows wisdom.
Maybe myself.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
Me?  Of course.
Can you really tell from doing that?
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
The past?
Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
What do you want?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
New York is dangerous place.
You look like you have.
You're twenty minutes late.
Must you fight him?
Get out.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
I know, Paul.
How can that be?
Aye -- that I would, lass.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
It was stolen.
Keep trying.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
What?
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
You said they would be here!
Close.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
I know.
How about dog shit?
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Keep your head down.
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
Yes, sir.
What's my name?
We're okay.
Where are you right now?
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
How do I reach him?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
There is nothing to it.
I don't have that much.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
I don't understand.
Their people?
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
What did you overhear?
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
The front gate would be best, General.
Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
Business is good at the hotel?
Very good.
I am always glad to see you Paul.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Youre drunk.
Thank God.
This goes out live?
Why sir?
What cards?
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Let's have dinner first.
Jean Baptiste!
Murdered! By whom?
It will do just fine.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
So where is the lamb?
In Ruhengeri?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
What is his room number?
-- bullshit --
If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Over here!
Prove it how?
I'm better than that.
And then where are we?
Let's try down here...
Better living through electricity.
It'll have to do.
Jesus!
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
And here's your goddamn severance!
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
It works.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
What's going on?
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
I'm sorry.
By freeing them.
She's down...how do you mean honey?
What about all my other stuff?
Take me to her.
Daddy, please!!!
Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
I don't know.  That's strange.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Oh come on!
No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
White meat will be fine...
Did you know her very well?
What!
Why?
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
And you...are?
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Runic?
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
And what is ... this frozen moment?
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Oh yeah ...
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Did you know him?
No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
Every day.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Buying some drugs, alright?
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ...
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Can we see?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
A prize?  For what?
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Fuck you!
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
I miss you too.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Rutherford Auction... that name...
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"Every day you meet quite a few."
"You could be swinging on a star."
Why try?
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
I was the Warden?
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
I don't care.
We're here to say, your government was right.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
You want an address on that last one?
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Just shut up and hit me!
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
The Hudswinger!
He didn't look unhappy!
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
...Huh?
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Your i --
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
Now, Aim --
Norville!
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Phony, huh?
Sez who?
I filed it yesterday.
Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
An example must be made!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
...It is?
Say, that was a swell idea!
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yessir.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
He notices.
He don't look wise.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
Alive?
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
Yes.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
I'm sorry...
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
Why did you come in here?
Instead -- you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that.  Don't call it nothing.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
That's past -- that's over and done with...
You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
What about her?
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
Elena.
What do you think?
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
That one.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
You're not going to --
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Grades?
Hnnn.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Ben--
Yeah?
Birth control.
What?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Nah.
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
It was all junk!
It was lovely!
Of course.
With Mikey?
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
Oh Wendy.
How'd you know?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
But not too ashamed.
Ouch.
Flame on, asshole.
My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
One for you and one for me.
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
No!
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Great, thanks for the tip.
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Hey Sandy.
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
One more shot?
Sure.
It's only gonna make you crazy.
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.
That must have been awful for you.
Okay.
Five feet?  Seven feet?
Where is he?
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
Seven years.
Will?
Don't do this, Hap...
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
Kay Connell.  Did you love her?
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
You're not missing much.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
What was?
I was a mentor to her.
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
Louis, I swear I did not.
No.
We are a pair, and that's what counts.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Why not?
Don't mock, Claudia...
The swamp...
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
You want death? Is it death you want?
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Sure...
Forget the crucifix. Take him.
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
And they frighten you?
I tried...
You have it...
I'm a vampire.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
Yes.
And you know what you ask for?
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
But, he said he'd try.
Is he?
Why are you being like this?
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
Never do that again.
That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?
Who?
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
I'll talk real slow.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Hey --
The rest of us see bathrobes.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently  walked blindly.
No.  She shall not be left here.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
I think not.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
They shall not hurt you
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
You have forgotten my last name?
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Her family name?
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
You are my friend.
I shall not leave the island 
Well, all right . . .
All right  all right.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Yeah, very funny.
Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
Well, wait and see.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
They went out of business years ago.
Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child  simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Give the flower a drink.
Will you try to get some sleep?
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Old college graduate now, huh?
A cattle boat?
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Uh-huh.
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . This direction?  Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
No.
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Well, no younger than I was.
Maybe you were born older, George.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Very funny. Very funny.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
All of it?
Hello?
This way.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Have you notified the police?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Ummmmm . . .
In that place?
About what?
Where'd you get that dress?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Well, then, sit down.
Thank you.
What is it, a sore throat or what?
You going to the lighthouse?
What the hell.  For you....
I think we're changing course a little.
I hope that's the cousin.
We better go back in.
We'll take your supercargo.
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Anyone got another set of sails?
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
If there is, develop it!
Every day?
Do I have to?
Because.
Is that what it is?
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
That's it.
Can't you tell?
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
Why?
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Good.
Nothing, huh?
No.
Do you?
Sean's asleep.
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
Just one minute....
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Thank you, thank you.  You know my son, don't you?
We're alone.
Two of them are still missing!
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
That's what he said.
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
That's you.
Maybe.
Ready?
Nope.
I can't stop thinking!
Give me back my hat!
Just like this.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
You do everything your parents tell you?
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Yeah.
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
Brody's riding his tower.
Oh, shit.
He thought he had a good reason.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
I can get it.
And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it!
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Honey, I gotta go.
It's his work.
Not enough loving.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
Are you scared?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Make up your mind.
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
After what happened to us?
Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
What's that?
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
Sean, that's right...
How's your patient?
What's up?
So tell Calvin.
I have to get out of here.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
I'm  fine.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
No, no.  That won't do.
I told you, something's upset them.
That's preposterous!
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Let's hope he knows that.
Why?
Thanks for helping.
Not at all.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
Not good enough.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
No, think of something else.
Goes up.
Hold still, damn it!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Hey.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
I want to see Kathryn.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
That bugger moves fast.
That's what grandmas are for.
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
It's time for tea, Grandma.
Tell Matt he should be here....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
What's wrong?  What happened?
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
It's beginning....
Spent it all on beer....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Stop what?
I'm not doing anything.
Can't help myself....
Good.
Thank you....
You're silly....
Good night, Daddy....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
The plane's turning....
I'm terrific... Come on....
A big one....
I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
What?
My vision is perfect....
I do....
You're the man who drives the plane.
She said it was coming....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
What's that....?
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
How's Ellen?
Feathers all over the place....
The females have eggs....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
So far..
Shit....
What?
How come only me?
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Stop that!
I don't like the song.
Mom....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
Here it comes....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
Yes.
Oh no--
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
How about any guys on your staff?
"Welcome to Eureka."
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
O.K.
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Are you sure you didn't call?
Hey ..
Bits.
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
No.
I'm talking, outside the girl?
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
No .. But we have a theory ..
Maybe he's lying to you?
How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
Wrong cabinet.
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
Me?
Yes.
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
Of course I would ..
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Oh.
How d'you know what I'm like?
I know.
Why?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
I know about alcohol, John.
Who sought the warrant?
What was she like?
He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>.
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
That's right.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Oh honey.  It's spun.
No.
There is something missing here.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
Oh come on --
Oh, tell the story.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
We are?
I just got goosebumps.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
We will be fine!
And I am...
Mission... statement...
Plus, you could use that commission.
I'm relieved you said that.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
And I appreciate that impulse.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Okay... I will...
What --
At eleven at night? _ 70.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
No--
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
Oh my God.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
It's a risk.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm asking you a question --
That's an answer.
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Beautiful.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Not a chance.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
Dick.
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
They do, my brother.
Shut up!!!
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
So do you.
What did you say!
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
That one time was just the bumper.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
How low?
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
Where is it?
I didn't know, there were two islands.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
NO!
My favorite.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
The last of my breed.
A well-accepted theory.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Are you sure?
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
It doesn't matter what I think.
John . . .
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
Which one?
How close do you have to be?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
Piss.
Oh, God.
I don't know.
She's with Sarah!
I have to find Kelly!
We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
What's that?
But why?
Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Pretty sure.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
John....
Why?
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Dilophosaurus.

That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
Yeah.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
No.
I doubt it.
"Thunder lizard!"
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
This is a seventy-seven ton animal.  Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow.  Look at it's teeth?  Come here, girl.  This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!
Machines hate you?
What?  What can we do?
Who?
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
Alright.
You're a beautiful big animal.
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
Thanks for the presents.
They don't bother me.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Yeah?
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
Uh-huh...
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Think it'll do any good?
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.
Success or nothing?
Yes.
It's my last and final one.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
It's what I'm paid to do.
You're detestable.
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
I do.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
One of you must be mistaken.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
You don't believe that.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
I don't know.
We know that.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
Then why haven't I been --
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
You look tired.
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
What's to become of us now?
I can't imagine you crying.
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
Yeah.
Why?
What's that?
Sure dear, yes.
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
Yes?
I'd just be guessing.
Do you always have to repeat?
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
-- Yes.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
My name's John Klute.
No, I'm look --
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
He never told me.
Goodbye.
Why?
I don't get you.
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
We did this before.
Yup.
What?
You and I -- a relationship.
I was wondering what that was.
With Trina.
Trask wants to talk with you.
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
OK.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Then, close the case.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
It's in the report.
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
Did she talk about him to you?
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
No.
Nobody's seen that.
Yes?
I see you have people there. What are their names?
What about your mommy?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Sorry.
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
C'mon, there's not much difference--
Oh...
Is that really your chair?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Like a principal?
Where will my toys be?
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
And would you describe those years as happy?
And yet you chose to leave him?
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
Objection!
Objection!
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
No.
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
That represents a gross billing in excess of two million--  What?!
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
What about Billy?
I'm not taking him with me.
NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
Fine.
Yes...How's Billy?
You have?
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
I'm going to take it.
I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
How many?
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
You're sure?
No.  I don't think so.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
Sure.
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Where are you from?
Can I do anything I want?
But, I am in charge.
General Chiang.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
I pooped.
I miss him too.
Not until you are eighteen.
When it is time.
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
Britain chooses not to.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
Please, come in, so cold.
As you say.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Ahh.
Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
You, kill me?
These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
Does he treat you fairly?
Much too young.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
What's going on?
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Never been to Maine before?
What?
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
That's probably good.
Excuse me?
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
He looks like a giant tea bag.
Take him.
He heeds a tourniquet.
Obviously I was wrong!
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Seconds.  Three, four.
You talk to the married couple?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
I'm sorry.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
Wait.
A tooth?
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Wild guess.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
You and Kevin.
It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
Myra.
Thanks, Ardelia.
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
Hot damn, Clarice.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Thanks.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
Yes sir.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Why?
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
But if he knew we have so little time -
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
Dr. Lecter...
She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there.
May I see your credentials?
I have no doubt of it.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
Then please - do this test for me.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Mmm. And what else...?
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
Early. Still dark.
Yes...! They were screaming.
Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
We leave in the morning?!
Absolutely.
Sorry to disappoint you...
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
No.
England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account...  of greed for land and furs.
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
You forget yourself!
Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
Sir!
Atten-hut!
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
Not exactly a big ocean country.
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
What?...
Can you fix it?
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
Unfortunately.  We can't.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
I'm not touching you!
I still will, if you don't mind.
You get the guns?
They were . . .
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Good job, Chris.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
All right, Dad.
Out the back.
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
I'11 meet you in the car.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
I will loan you the money.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
And that does include the amp?
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
How many feet?
Just shut up.
So?
And what did she do?
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Nice job.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
That's not the point.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
That's in Maverick County.
You were in a fight--
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
No sir.
They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
You know who I am?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
Cliff--
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
Good deal you were born down here, then.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
That's right.
Right.
Why would you want to do that?
Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
You go by your old house?
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
Sam--
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Not if I can help it.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
No. Is he sick?
He's going to wish he was dead.
Could of been. That was white people's business.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
So I've heard--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
I'll see what's going on.
We haven't talked since high school.
Are you okay?
Want to take a walk?
Most people did, yeah.
No--
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
They've got me. Different thing.
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
Yeah.
More, I hope.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
No, Sheriff, I'm just--
And people better clear out of here! Now!
What's up?
You sell much out here?
Yeah.  It's French.
A Nix specialty?
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
Deep shit?
He's a priest?
It's an illusion.
I don't know.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
No.
You said you weren't with him for love.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
It's okay.
You saw this?
... they believe you.
Oh God.
--vanished.
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
Maybe I just bought it.
Philip Swann?
Are you sure?
What for?
I like to know why things happen.
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Shit...
What?
Yes...
Was he taking a lot of risks?
Have you been in?
And you believed him?
Looks that way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
Yes?
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
One question.
Who is she?
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Two years.
Oh.
Thanks.
No.
Hi, Charlie.
I see them every morning.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
You're possessive.
Yeah? But look at you.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
Oh.
No one ever tells you that...
How old is she?
Yeah.
No, we'll find something around here.
Tomorrow.
I'll miss you.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Yes?
Hello, darling.
Bob?
Uh, no.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
When are you coming home?
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
I got some hair stuff.
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
I can't believe Will killed him.
Peter, are you okay?
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
I think I should join you.
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
You ready?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Yes.  We won, that's right.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
I didn't know what else to do...
Yes... and you are?
And also that...
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
What's that got to do with you?
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
What's the...OH SHIT!
When's your birthday?
No oxygen to the brain.
What about after?
Sure.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
Not a lot.
You are the younger of two...
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Of course.
Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Need any help?
I can manage.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Thanks, sweetheart.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
You're a caterer?
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Uh-huh.
Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
I don't wanna see that.
To do what you love.
No one's forcing her.
He's in college?
And he's fine, girl.
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
I was just showing emotion.
She hates all freshmen.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
You do act different.
Five seconds.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
I don't.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
You don't look half-bad.
Whatever, big head.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Why not?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Quincy...
We're going to get some food.
Are you out of your mind?
You forgot to be there.
Stay!
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
You're what?
So that's it, just forget about us?
Kiss my ass.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
You're serious.
Then why are you so upset?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
So?
With who?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Okay.
Sorry.  You okay?
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
You came out early.
I mean, it's not true, is it?
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
Lucky kid.
I don't know.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
You ok?
ooohhhhhh no.
Hello, Phil.
Oh that's good.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, but I don't know --
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
I don't have a boyfriend.
That's great, thank you.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
I'm sorry.
Please, yes.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Billingsley's?
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
Can I tell you something?
It's ok.
Yes I do.
Just say no.
Where's Richard and Julia?
What?
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Bite it, Cynthia.  You could get free things from people that want you to endorse their products.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
This sounds threatening.
Well --
-- Samuel Johnson.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
I'm sick.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
Gently, son --
-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.  And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
I need to sit down.
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
...ah...
No.
I've seen it before.
It's ok.
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
....getthat on the tv....there...
You got us a room so quick?
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
I would just want to clear some things up:
This isn't meant --
Are you asking me that?
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
Go ahead and waste your time.
Yeah.
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
Around here.
Right.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
They wouldn't?
Kind of.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
He's in here --?
Oh yeah.
There's no disturbance.
There's no disturbance.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
I don't have to answer your questions.
Are you lyin' to me?
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
No.
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
All your other fluzzies?
Yes.
Will you say my name?
Fuck.  I think I'm gonna throw up, I think.  I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old.
It'll take the pain away.
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
Yeah.
I'll answer anything.
Who?
I don't know....
Do you know the answer to this?
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
...I don't know...
No.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
Yes.  What's your name?
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
Where will the money go?
What does that mean?
Shut the fuck up.
What are you doing?
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM OR WHAT MY LIFE IS AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING BALLS, THE <u>INDECENCY</u> TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --
Yeah.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
That's it.
We need more dog food --
Should be one-thirty.
You're late, not me.
Stand up.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
Alright.
Hi.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
That is good.
M'lady...?
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I am preparing for a ball!
You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
I am with you!
Soon enough.  Here we are.
Come, we have a boat waiting.
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
You can do it.
The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
There are more important things than tits.
Forgiveness?
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
Come on...
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
Your Majesty has had many women --
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Yes, your Majesty.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
No, Keeper.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
Sire, I --
You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
What do you think?
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Fine...
What?
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Yeah?
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Could explain why Fleming was there.
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
What exactly did you see?
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
County jail - get in.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
Christ!
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
'You're very beautiful.
I have to.
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
What else did you keep out of the papers?
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
No other possibilities?
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Get me a plane...
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
That's narrow?
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
There has to be.
You wanna watch this or what?!
Three minutes.
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
Yes.
Who?
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Please, no.
Not me.
Are you a man?
You'll let me go now?
Yes?
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
She'll be in, in the morning...
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
I don't understand.
Why do you think I called?
He's misunderstood.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
What did he want?
He asked how you are.
And you said?
We have it good, don't we?
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
No.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Is Crawford going with you?
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Go on to the house.
Are you George Sherman?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
How did it happen?
She got all right?
I keep getting it for Christmas.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
Yes.
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Kevlar Second Chance.
Tank you veddy much.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
Tony Clifton.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
No thanks.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
If you want...
It's me.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
Andy... there is no real you.
You're a wimp.
And you're just poor white trash!
Positive.
I'll take my chances!!
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
I used to think you were original.
He said he's coming back!
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
What?
Should Tank I.D. it?
Oh, God.
I know.  It's her fault.
You don't, do you?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
You killed them.
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
No, it's all right.
How?
Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
Are they any agent?
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
Yes.  Now.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
What do you know?
You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
You could say that.
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
Why?
That's why we're here.
Yes I do.
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
I need the main wet-wall.
We're on our way --
Do it!
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
What?
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
No.
What choice?
No, you're not.
Yeah?
Hell yes!
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
What are you talking about?
Duck!
Dozer?
Well the guy over there said...
Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
Why?
I gotta get the stuff.
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
Anybody wanna have a game?
'Thou art then a king?'
Don't promise...just deliver.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
How?
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
Fine.
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
No.
It's still sick.
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Sure...He lives there?
You're intolerable today.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
Count it.
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
You mean it's heisted.
You what?
Quiet please.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Sure.
You think so?
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
Red or white?
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Hello, Quince.
I didn't say.
'Yes' to the deal?
Did you just hear something?
What?!
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Yours.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
I don't think so.  Do you?
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Yeah.  Neat.
Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
Make it go 'way.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Mine, too.
She knows you real self?
Don' need you okayin'.
The Board is waiting.
What?
Didn't you call a Board meeting?
Yes?
It's so very nice to see you again.
I didn't know that.
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
Thanks.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I don't have any.
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
Watch me do what?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
I mean I appreciate that.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
'Love will find out the way'.
I believe that, don't you?
Thank you for loving me.
Closer than that.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
A 'deal'?
You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
That's what everybody says.
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
Well...I don't know.
Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
An offense --
That's me.
And then --?
'The one' to do what?
Watch it!
Thank you, Quince.
Sure.
I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
I hope so.
Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
I agree --
Did I say something wrong?
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
That's it?
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
As requested.
Hi, Leonard.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Do you remember me?
Don't say anything else.
You did explain, Lenny.
Yes.
Yes.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
What?
Where is he?
Why would you do that?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Help me.
Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Are you Teddy?
I'm not appealing the decision.
Then why are you here?
I enjoy it.
You know it?
I don't know.
Prove it.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
Your name's Teddy.
"And" what?
I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"...
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
Where's the new drop point...?
It's a rip and a hit.
Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
Make it 35.
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
And what is that?
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
Of course.
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
Stevens?
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
"No, viejo.  That was Jos Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
Nothing.
Where?
We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in <i>The Miami Herald</i> to impress the slug farm in DC...
And Jos, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
We don't know.
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
How will it stand up?
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
Sonny...?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to know...
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
Do we need this...?
I had to lay eyes on you.
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
The Statue of Liberty.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
Yeah?
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
And what?
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how should I know?
You bet I do, sir.
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
We go through the wall?
KNOCK IT OFF!
How's your hernia?
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Yes...?
I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
How long?
What?  You gotta be joking.
After we're outside the kogus?
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
I know where it is.
Oh shit.
Maybe he's changing jobs.
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  I arrange everything - just right.  And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Yeah...?
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
I pull.
You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You...
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Maybe they lied to you.
Right.
No.
That's why we should do it now.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
I'm not much of a critic.
The phones are working?
I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.  'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
--not fair?
I'm telling you, I can't.
Yeah, yeah...
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
It's perfect.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
It is.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
That's disgusting.
Maybe.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
That's nice.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
How do you that.
I suppose I did.
Lovely.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
Ninety-three point four million.
..or hard wired..
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
What are you talking about?
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
Exactly where is she?
I hope there's a place to land.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
Do what?
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you..
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
I'll muddle through.
It's going to be okay.
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
You were there.
Twice.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
Yes, I believe that's right.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
She sacrificed herself..
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
That simple, huh?
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
She must still be on the property.
I told her to get outta there.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
What about him...?
Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
You didn't have to.........
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
This stuff is so sticky.
Go secure.
Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Yeah.  I follow you.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Why was there another team?
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
That depends.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
IMF mainframe.
Where exactly is it?
Just waiting for you, tubs.
I didn't touch it.
Give me a break, Pops.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
Sure.  If the main character does.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Too wicked to have a drink later?
I think I might just take that look.
And a lonely ass.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
Thank you, Rose.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
I know that. I do what I want.
Bus hit him.
Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?
Seven years ago.
Just Johnny.
Why you talking to me?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
What are you talking about?
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
How can you ask me that?
You're late!
We're here.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah, I'll be in.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
Will you marry me?
Seven-thirty.
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
A month from today?
Pop.
What! How do you know?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Are you drunk?
He's with his dying mother!
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
Did you see it?
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
I... a... slept with my fianc's brother.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
I don't know.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
You don't know where Loretta is?
Johnny...
Sure!
Absolutely!
That woman was a student of yours?
Nerves.
No.
People home.
What? What?
Oh. Right.
I knew she had it.
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Please!
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
All right!  What do you want?
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
You said it again!
What?
Course I have.
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Come Here.
Bedevere, my Liege.
OF course, my Liege ...
What does it say?
It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.

Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Follow!
There he is!
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Shut up!
Yes, Lord.
... Well, we did do the nose.
What is your quest?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
To seek the Grail!
They cost fifty pounds each!
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Oh, I see,  Right.
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
You are in great peril.
... I Bet you're gay.
We must examine you.
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
Shut up.
I didn't.
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
It's what the maids are for.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
We --
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
This is a slur on her good name.
Do you hunt?
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
The greasy pole.
No love.
And the pony?
She's well, too.
I'm glad of it.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
Those, over there, there.
Are they worth reading?
Who by?
What does he know about the Highlands?
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Yes, ma'am?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
We'll see which way the wind blows.
To know when he'll be king.
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
Why?
Why not?
You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
How do you do that?
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
What's her problem?
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
Hey, kid.
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
So how did it know my name, then?
You imagined it.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
It's already out.
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
Dante's Inferno.
Yeah.  The Inferno.
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
But I don't understand...
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
So how do I start?
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
Yeah.
What did I say?
Okay.
So, what did they say?
Well, I ...
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
You got it! See you later honey.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
Before what?
Can you tell me what happened?
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
What do you mean?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
I'm not sure about this.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
No.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
Oh boy.
You see what I mean...
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Right then.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Where at?
Palmdale.
Hardly.
Not a coke or anything?
Sure.
No one has a gun to your head.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
We wait. This is an elevator.
I'm working on it.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
I work here, remember ?
What ?
What ? Are you my mother ?
So ?
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
We will start work on it now sir.
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable.
Better, sir.
Sir ?
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
What ?????
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Thank you.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
What ?
Who was that guy anyway ?
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Don't mention it.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Totally.
Can I see him?
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
You're being narrow-minded.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Maybe he's hungry.
Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
Special effects?
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
Well...
That's okay.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Rose.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
He said it was a gift.
What if you don't wanna be found?
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
Owh...
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Good. I mean...
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
An adventure?
You're a good man Nicholas.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
I should do this myself.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
Is that a yes?
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
Yes, I do.
Something wrong?
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
Vada!!
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
You're such a baby.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
Well the other night at dinner...
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
I wrote that.
No kidding?
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
Okay.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
What happened to her?
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
I don't know which ball's mine.
Can I go too?
No, sweetie, not yet.
Soon honey, soon.
No sweetheart, you can't.
Why not?
He was allergic to bees.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Hi, is Vada home?
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Bye.
Come here, sit down over here.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Yes it is.
Chocolate?
Thomas?
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
I'm eleven and a half.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
I'm trying.
Come on, it's fun.
It's my mother.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Sorry.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
But I have my clothes on!
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
Okay on the count of three.
Would you think of me?
I should look different.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
The wandering sportswriter.
I have a suggestion...
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
Good girl.
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Let me rephrase that...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Gold nose hair clippers.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
Well, somet...
Hate that.
My very point.  Here's another one...
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
Like I said, dazzling.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
The night we met.
Yes.
That's my point!!
Get married, apparently.
That is so romantic.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
Like family, huh?
What is that sup...
And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
You got a real good memory, Star.
What do you have to buy?
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
Don't feel that way, honey.
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
What did you say your name was?
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
Bye, Bye.
She's going to rest now.
Oh, sure.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
Have you talked to Triplette?
What!
I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
Where the hell have you been?
How in the world did he get shot?
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
A little. What do you need?
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
What year?
The car broke down.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Fungus?
I don't think so.
Does their hair fall out?
Bye.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
That's not quite what I had in mind.
I don't know who you are.
What?
I can't.
Oh.
What?
It's me. What is it?
Glad to meet you.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
I mean...
I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
Where are you from?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
I know a couple.
I'll be dammed.
You think I got any kind of a voice?
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Who is we?
Thank you, sir.
You been followin' the news coverage?
What?
What I'd like to do---
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Says who?
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Two-thirty. Shhh...
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.
Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Two guys?
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
Out.
No thanks.
You a union man?
What did you say your name is?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
I don't know.
Don't say much, do you?
And his age?
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
You working?
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
What d'you expect?
How d'you mean?
No thanks.
You almost got into trouble back there.
No.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
I'll see you later.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
How about it?
No. But a small one.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
I keep thinking about him.
Day work.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
What 'you signifyin'?
What's on your mind?
Just tryin' to be helpful.
I guess I ain't.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
I know.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
Since when?
Of course.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
It hasn't yet.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
Can you walk?
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
We got problems topside.
Less than thirty minutes.
It's coming.
No!... No...
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
I don't know. I don't know...
And Linda...
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
What are you talking about?
Well, do you?
Yeah. Let's do that.
Petty good.
Yes, it's lame.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
You're Pam?
Okay. That's bad.
Anita!
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
By Guy?
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Five-- Six--
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Oh. Right.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Is that true?
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
You like her?
Thank you.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
I don't have to say that.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Wow. You believe in me that much--
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
I finally found my story.
Why?
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Nah uh.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
We're very evolved.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
No!
For this.
If you went away, what would become of me?
Can't you make other creations?
Experiments?
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
It's getting there.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Who's Lisa?
Ken!
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
He'll die with me!
What about it?
Yeah, why?
No shit.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
I know.
Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
All of them.
I'm sure you would.
First door up the stairs.
Hi Mom.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Can't it wait till morning?
How's your hand?
He's close...
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
You did it the other night.
How do we find him, Kristen?
He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.
Nancy...
Never been here before?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
Everybody take five.
Anything?
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
Neil, please --
You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
Mary Helena.
Uh, fourteen.
Me too.
I'm a vegetarian.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
I'm an actress.
Fifteen million dollars.
Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
Orange juice -- probably not.
Oh right.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Ahm...
Exactly.  Here we go again.
Step aside.
Why?
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
I have thought about you.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Well, get a message through to him too.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
Well...
Oh.
Undressed like this, yes.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
That's spectacularly unfair.
And what would you say...
Who is it?
What's your name?
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Yup.
Right. 
I never fancied you much actually...
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Di Caprio.
You daft prick!
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
The others?
Yes?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
She's perfect, perfect.
So not over her, in fact.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
Does she know you're coming?
Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
And you get on very well.
Oh.  Right.
Oh sure.  Of course.
Bad news.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
No, Miss Ratched...
Would you like to start?
Tell us about it...
M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Yeah?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Please see to Mister Bromden.
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
Go ahead! Go back!
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay...
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Lend me twenty.
Sure, Mack...
Shhh...
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.
Me too...
Lobotomy!
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
Okay, sucker.
Just warmin' up.
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
It doesn't help him.
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
I'm busting outta this place.
I'm the coach!
No!
No!
Me. Hit me!
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
Yeah, it's cold!
He is!
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
Poker!
I see.
In what way?
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
I don't, Doc...
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
How do ya know that?
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
Shhh!  This way!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
What are they?
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Yes, ma'am...
Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Of course not.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Buona notte.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
Yes.  We did.
Oh no.  Do you?
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
Dwayne?
Amazing.
Non.  Please.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Who says I don't love him?...
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
Yeah.
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
In that case... no...
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
I can't believe you did that!
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
There is no us.
I brought you that, too.
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Oh, hello.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
But somebody wrote those songs.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
So?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
What is it?
Nothing.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
Because I'm the one who's single.
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
...and a fortune teller.
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
Kate.
A porco?
I'd love to.
That's exactly what you are.
Right.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
And you didn't tell her?
That's all. Next witness!
He was always a good kid. You know that.
But my own kid bro
Maybe he gave them an argument.
He probably gave 'em an argument.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Don't say that!
I could have been better!
The point is there isn't much time, kid.
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
The moment I saw you.
How would you've done it?
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Want to go out and have one with me?
In a saloon?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
But that's living like an animal
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
For not being any help?
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened I'm frightened.
Terry, for God's sake.
Every one of 'em... .
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
What are you going to do?
A question of who rides who.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
Down to the wire?
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
You'll work.
Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured  They got it made. Eat all they want fly around like crazy sleep side by side and raise gobs of squabs.
First things first.
I'll see you on the roof.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
I was only talkin' to her.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Be careful!
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
You're talking nonsense.
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
Ahh, she will be yours.
Ahh, there is yet time.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
Glenn Michaels.
Yes, it is.
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Who are you?
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Oh, man.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Uh-huh...
Let's go to Detroit.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
She just sat there, looking right at me.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
I don't know.
I'll go with you.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Daniel.  Listen --
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Call and tell you.
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Why you think is today?
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Another C.
Low class of people there, Snoop.
So you've done this before, huh?
Someone down here?
You're right.  So why take a chance--
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
Yeah...
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Don't leave me.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
That's not what you were about to say.
Why not?
You waved to me in the elevator.
I don't think we should get into that.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
When?
Any time.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
The fish?
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
You gonna write me a check?
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
I'm not leaving Midge.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Hejira.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
I remember you now.  Shit.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
Flyweight.
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
We don't get to talk much any more.
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
It's possible.  Why?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Foley's got it.
Ten gees.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
Power dive!
Kill the bastards!
Good shooting, Rafe!
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
She loves you.  I know that.  And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
What's there?
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
Then wh-where do we land?
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
We can explain, Colonel.
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
I know.
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
You too, 'Mam.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
Do one thing for me, before you go.
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
Fook ya!
Learn English, then!
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
I'm not telling.
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Peggy Sue!
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Save it.
Charlie. About last nights..
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Just take a look at it. 
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
You're going to listen to me.
What?
It opens, too. Look inside.
What about Janet?
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
What're you doing here anyway?
What are you shooting for?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
I hate chickens.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
He'll win.
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
Sort of.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Maddy's party.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Like what?
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I'm going out, Dad!
Anywhere but here.
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
There's a better place...
He was dead. You know he was.
What do you mean?
In a word, Bob...
Andy?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Drew!
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
No.
A carrot?!
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
We?
Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
They didn't fire her?
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
What do you love about it?
If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
That's right.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Objection.
Yes.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
That's correct.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
In a word, yes.
... we've got a committee meeting.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Duh...
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Okay, Joe...
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
Yeah... ?
My lettuce is wilting.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
Charles...
Charles...
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
'Mean the whispers?
What whispers?
Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
I can't....I can't....
I would try for them.
It's starting....
I know what's in here!
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Can we switch?
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
We just keep him locked up forever?
Thought you didn't believe his story.
25 kilos each, huh?
Wha'?
Never said you were a hype, either.
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Just realized that, huh?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
What are you doing there?
What's so special about him?
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Well, maybe they're not.
Yo!
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
What signal?
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
long pause) You know it.
I'm prepared to die.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
Don't bother
But I'm not prepared to die.
Okay.
The Hunt Club.
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Twelve hundred years ago.
Okay.Up to the cave.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
Maybe not.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
God bless you.
But perhaps he understood --
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
How the hell did he get away?
Says he can't walk.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Yeah.
Dawn...
...don't feel like it either.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Yeah, those are the guys that live. I really don't think Death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can, I think it takes whatever it can get... you never know where it's gonna come from anyway... so why spin your wheels?
Nah...
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
...there's nobody.
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Fuck you Elias.
Found it. Growing in a garden.
He dugged his own grave.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
I don't know.
You don't know.
Yes?
If I change my mind.
How careful should I be?
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
I see.
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
And do you amuse the guests?
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
Whatever you say.
Do you think I don't?
There wasn't any plane.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Quarter after one. Why?
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
So have I.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
This must have cost a fortune.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Beer or ale, Miss?
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Who told you I was married?
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
Sometimes.
Morning. Any calls?
Who's Goble?
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Would that make me a heel?
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
What?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
That's not enough.
Convenient, isn't it?
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
Would you?
Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
I think so.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Do I know who lives down there?
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
Pretty big chance, huh?
Not quiet yet.
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Not if it clears the air.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
So far.
Aye.  You have a point there.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
What are my orders, sir?
Nice.
That's not very kind.
It's kind of you to see me.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
I will, thanks.
Of course.
I'll have some of that.
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
Freshman and sophomores...
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And you're at this third stage
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
What did he want?
I know.  I'm sorry.
To the airlift.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
No need to thank me, if you don't want to.  Just pay for these drinks.
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
I'm waiting for your mother.
Not at all.  History.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Terrific.
Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
U-huh.
They won't let you in without one.
Voila!
Promise?
Not yet.
Once.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
You do it... you first!
Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Got it...
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Thanks, buddy.
Figured you did.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Meaning you were expendable.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Something... in the trees...
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
What story did you give to Davis?
It's been a long time, General.
Mmmnnn...?
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
You're not getting any navy contracts.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
You looking' for some company?
No.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Off the boulevard.
Exactly.
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
No shit.  They expensive?
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Why not?
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Come with me?
No.
Shall we mingle?
What if I lose it?
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
Business.
Afternoon.
We just did.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Goodbye, Bill.
I'm up.
Let him answer.
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah.
Was that you?
Yeah.  I just got it.
Go for the bucks.
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Steak spoon! 
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Excuse me?
All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
Of course you will.
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
There will never be a need.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
True!
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
Sire.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
It won't be easy, Sire.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
DEATH FIRST!!
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
There we cannot help you.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
I thought he was with you.
Hah?
We're really in a terrible rush.
You're sure nobody's following us?
Oh, have it your way.
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
An hour.
"Honeymoon,
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
You're going to jump on me.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Then stick with Bialystock!
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
What is she gonna do here?
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
I don't know.  I don't know.
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Get car.  Get car.
Oh, the best one.
I shall count the minutes.
Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
Of Siegfried...
The Blue Max...
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
What do you mean?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
My mother.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
A lot?
I ought to call the police right now!
Where's the old highway?
Sam! Why call when we can go?
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Huh?
What?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Why not?
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
Can you?
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
Los Angeles.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
Thank you. Again.
No.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
I imagine so.
Except you.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
To a private island, like you?
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
I'm sorry.
No need to apologize...
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
He's already been.
Arbogast.  And after he left?  No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there?  Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
Norman found them dead together.  In bed.
Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
Maybe you want my money, too.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
How? What can I do?
Yes!
The master ... is asleep!
But ... the dogs...
Why didn't you eat last night?
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
So that's the way it is?
That's the way I feel about it.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
That's what I said.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
That is unfortunate.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
But I have some friends waiting.
Yes.
Thanks.
You taking any medication?
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
Wait.  I want to tell you something.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
There was this old man that ate his niece.
Well, all right.
What did you expect?
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Well, some fiend might.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Yeah, he's still up there.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
What did you say, Brother?
I'll be right back.
No, he doesn't. Not really.
Yeah.
Let's go peep from the living room.
He kissed her.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
It's Yankee whisky to me.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
Of course.
Yes, we know her.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Got yourself up?
You don't know where you're going?
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
You mean a farm?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Oh, yeah?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
You're so sweet.
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
I don't mind.
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
You're not gonna see him again.
Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
I don't know.  Fuck off!
Abe Lincoln...
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
What'd I say?
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
Stop blaming yourself.
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Feeling great.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
No, but it should.
It's go time, Billy-B.
Follow me.
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
No.
Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
Can't I?
You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
All for one...
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
You cannot escape your destiny.
I can't kill my own father.
Jabba's palace.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
Ahhh...
Lower it!
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Let's see.
We shall double our efforts.
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
Your Royal Highness.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Disintegrated?
Yes.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
We must have a blow-out.
Yes.
Oh don't be so shy.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
From Transexual Transylvania.
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Oh no no no no.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
The glasses... Please.
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
It did.
No... Sharp -- You look great.
Don't want weak legs.
What did you say about a pet shop?
C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
You didn't!
Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
It's not your house --
I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
...Of the truck that run over your face.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
No dollar.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Six!
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Ya still light seventy.
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Rocky.
What?
...What?
How old?
...Did ya fight last night?
Ain't they?
Think about it.
When was they here?
Yeah.
Please, kid.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
'Bout what?
Looks, huh?
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Maybe ya better forget it.
It don't bother me none.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
What gaps?
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Shoulda guessed.
That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
Maroon, right?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
So you're Cloverleaf?
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
Toon cops worked me over.
Does it hurt?
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
I don't work in Toontown.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Maybe.  Why?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
You tricked me, damn you!
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
Yeah, that's better.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Yeah?
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Then I'll leave thee.
Am I like Such a fellow?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
In love?
No, cuz, I rather weep.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
'Tis he.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
A most courteous exposition.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
Is she a Capulet?
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
This is important.
I'm up for that...
Once.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Duty calls?
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
Shut up!
You first, Edvard.
What do you mean?
What's that?
I swear...
I sent it to myself in Paris.
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
I know of him.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Nothing...
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
None of them had any --
I don't know what you're -
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Why?  Are you kidding me?
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
We don't know that.
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
Maybe.  Who cares?
What's that?
Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
He killed her...he killed her...
What's your offer, Jesse?
How much?
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
HELLLLLP!!!!
Hello.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
OK.  I love you.
And I'd take it out on him.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
Could it have been this?
A week ago, at most.
I have a better plan.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Have I seen her?
Oh.
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Dwayne put the gun down --
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Anything in it?
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
What do you think?  Heart attack?
No, sir.
The band has been playing over an hour.
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
No.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
Try to land on your feet.
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
It's my job!
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
You.
I cannot go to LA...
You said --
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
It's a long story.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
What?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
Mind your own business.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
No.  I'm going to find out.
I did!
We have to get to the Penthouse.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
Some Kung-Pao?
Fine with me.
Excuse me?
How do I know I can trust you?
Any leads?
It's my responsibility.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Yes, Master.
Ricky Tan?
Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
OK. Say what it is.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
A little.
We are both full of shit.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
Shortcut?
No.
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Stooly.
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Yeah, it's good.
It's him.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
The Feds?!
I could get promoted right out of here.
What's wrong with that?
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
How much they want?
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Yes.
You have what I asked for?
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Carter, can I have a moment?
I was trying to find the right time.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Of course.
Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Why do YOU think she ran?
Oh, please!
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Tootaloo.
Looking for Maggie.
Really?
Seven-fifty.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Agreed.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
What happened at the luau?
I'm just finishing up, too.
Okay.
No.  It's my life.
A harmless joke.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
I hate boats.
It sounds nice.
But it's on the water.
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
Nope.
Even when you were young?
I don't think so.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
I do.
It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
I told you.  Nothing --
About what?
Not.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
I know.
Turn on your radio!
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
Becky?
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
How amazing.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
You know.
What?
You don't believe in signs.
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
No.
Right, right.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
It plays in 50 states.
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Sure.  Looking good.
She's willing to fly anywhere.
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
Good.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
Now I'm late.  Bye.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Everyone at work heard you.
Victoria? She's okay.
Did not.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Hi.  Sam?
Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
You could have called me --
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
Yeah.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
He'll have it good. Some day.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
The what!
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
Are you Australian?
No, Why?
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
I'll see you tonight.
Leave me out of this.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
You get off on abuse or something?
How far out of town?
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
I need my paycheck.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
My features. They're Finnish.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
Don't get carried away.
Not tonight.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
No. I'm good.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
No, I'm good.
Make me an offer.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
But I just met you.
No last name?
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
I thought you'd be happy.
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Just admit you're wrong.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
Better than drugs.
Sir?
In West Fork?
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
The hell he didn't.
Cap'n...?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Who's Wade?
White-walls?
It was nothing.
You know classical music?
You?  Leading a squad?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Uh, Captain...
Since when have things been normal?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Nope.
Three for three.
Oh, yeah?
And how do you bluff yourself?
You're welcome, John.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
Sure, Reiben.
There's always a bright side.
Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
I coach the baseball team, too.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Okay, thanks.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
I'll be home soon.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
C'mon, just do it.
Yes.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Read it.
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Wait a minute.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
He'd like to start serving immediately.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Goodnight.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Dad, I love him.
This is me telling you about me.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Goodbye.
No.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Job?  Being a great date.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
You think so?
Me?  Sure I do.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
I'm doing alright.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Then why are you shaking?
Yeah.
You shared it with a dick.
Did you talk to Corey?
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Then don't do it.
Oh shit.
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
No.
The truck?
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
Just her name.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
Now you're back.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
You're kidding.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
You're not telling me something.
This is not my problem.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
What others?
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
You're sure about this two person thing?
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
I heard a noise.
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
What? I can't hear you...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Someone who wants to talk to you.
That's okay.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
You freakin?
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done.
Miss Weathers.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
Not good.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
You're getting obvious.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
The safety what? Fuck that!
I have to watch rehearsal.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
I'd really just like to be alone.
The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
She's not here right now.
Closer than you think.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Thanks.
Reaction to what?
Nope.
Please, call me Gale.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Absolutely.
How is that good news?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Show him.
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
And who is that?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Fuck!
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
What?  What movie?
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
I'm sorry, your voice.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
She looked dead. Still does.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Yeah... I think so.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Fuck you.
Do I?
What's that noise?
Uh-huh.
Guess.
Dial someone else, okay?
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
Deputy... good evening.
Then what are you doing here?
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
Sidney's father?
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
You're sure it was the Hilton?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
Should I be worried?
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
What is it? Where's Casey?
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
I want to talk to you.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
LEAVEMEALONE!
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
Got it.
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
She's saving herself for you.
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
Wanna another beer?
No way.
He was there, Tatum.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
Deal.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
What the fuck is going on?
Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
Is there any blood in it?
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Just wait!
Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
Oh, that's all.
The fingerprints.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
Oh, it's alright.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
How do you know all about this?
We're focusing.
It's not what you think it is.
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
Kiss me on the lips.
Don't do this... please...
Oh... um, William.
It's a hard place.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
He mentioned it.
I don't know...
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
I don't know.
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
What, Ben?
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Captain Clayton...Captain!
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
I'm Clayton.
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
If they're still alive...
How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
Whatchu doin'?...
Scar?
Think she means for us to follow?
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
What's the sense in it!
Not likely.
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Comancheros...
No...not yet...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
From the beginning...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Oh God, Tommi...
I'll do it myself.
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
I just had a really strange experience.
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Maybe an animal.
What are you talking about-
But what is the truth?
Does this dog here belong to you?
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
We should leave the past alone.
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
Thank you, Ned.
Right you are, governor!
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Treachery!
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
Ten pounds.
Ned is wrong for it.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
There's never any
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
So what do we do?
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
It is all locked safe in here
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
I don't know. It's a mystery.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
The daughter of his enemy.
The daughter of his enemy.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
I have to get back.
The same, alas.
Oh, not for the world!
It is strange to me, too.
And that was only my first try.
There is time. It is still dark.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
But why me?
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
What of her bosom?
I was trying to educate you.
I don't have time.
I'm only asking what you think.
Come on, David.
When are you going to let the police know?
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
Is that going to be deep enough?
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
How much?
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I beg your pardon?
So I gathered.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
But there's no --
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Cameron?
For the flat.
-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
Yeah.
You see, they don't really know me.
Hugo.
Yes.
Yes.
Is that all?
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
I want my money back. Excuse me.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
You know we're right.
Your painful groin?
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
We could put it somewhere.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything.
Can we come in?
There are only two other people in the flat.
No, three. Who said there were four?
Yes, absolutely.
Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Yes.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
Who have you talked to?
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
I'm not sure --
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
What guy?
That guy, the one that died.
Would you like to come in?
The telephone? It continues to ring.
All right.
A certain weakness.
I write about it?
The first one was fine.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Yes.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
What?
That you were just indulging me.
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
It turned out to be cancer.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Hello, George.
She's a friend of Jill's.
No.
Are you?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
No thanks.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Why?
What?
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Yeah... wow.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
What?
Hey, I don't tell.
You did, didn't you?
You did, I know you did.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
Yeah, baby...
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
-- what guy?
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
Mmmm --
Not me, pal.
Look about last night --
That's it, then I'm leaving.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
What?
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- yeah, this is --
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
That's too bad.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Where?
George, I don't --
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
You're different.
Of course I like children.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
How did it go at the bank?
Right now?
When is that?
... Okay...
Where's your car?
Baby, don't do this --
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
I said you were a loser!
No.
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
Did they have something against me?
I wanna hear it from you!
What about Jackie?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
I am?
Whatever his name is, that actor.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
That's not very logical, Lester.
Fine.
See you later.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
We don't think marriage is important.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
It's been so long I don't how long?
What?
-- Yesss?
Didn't you have any panties on?
What did you do?
But why Egypt?
He's a hairdresser.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
No.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Have they sat down?
I guess so.
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Room 237?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
No.
Okay, Mom.
Yes.
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Who?
A nigger cook.
Grady... oh.
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
What time is it?
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Oh, it sure would be
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
They'll love it.
Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Stop it!
Went shopping. Why?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Rattling. Rustling.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
Good.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
What the hell does that matter?
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
Well... was it a prescription?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
But Uncle Al! You said-
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
LET THY SPIRIT
I think they hear you!
HE'S SO FINE...
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You know it.
That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Joey -- do it.
What is it, Betty?
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Chops?
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Enough jabber.
Whatever.
Wet behind the ears.
Amateurs 2
Sing!
I... I brought you something.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Honey.
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
Your cigarette -- out.
Deal.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
What's wrong with my life?
We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
In English?
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
You have a phone call.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
I'm a Christian.
Don't push it.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
Maybe Hawaii.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
Nuns?
Yeah, like what?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Really.
They open a window.
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
I'm telling you!
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
Measles.
That was exciting!
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
But, Bishop...
How did you hear this?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
I was afraid of this.
To place it inside its coffin.
What are you spying on?
Bring him.
You need rest.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
What of it?
He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
Hmm?  See them?
May we look at them now?
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
At times I do.
What happened?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
Other people?
Are you so superstitious?
I insist that you have it.
They have done nothing of the sort.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
I apologize if I worried you.
And, what did he say?
Use caution.
Very little.  I must be going...
I didn't see none.
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.  Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?
Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door.  Them french fries good?
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
You have any biscuits for sale?
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
It's too big.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
Don't tell me what to do.
Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really.  You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
You enjoying yourself, Karl?
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
What are all them books?
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Did you want to play ball with us?
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
I like the way you talk.
Yeah.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
All right then.
Yeah, I recollect it.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
A little ol' boy.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Yeah.
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
I've got a feelin' today.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
I'm glad of it, honey.
Did Karl go to bed?
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
You better go get your things.
All right then.
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
What's that you say?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
I know.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
I didn't mean that.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Will he be supervised?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
A photographer ...
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Slow down, huh?
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
No you're not.
Five thousand bucks.
For keeps.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Lovely.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 
And why the hell would you give me money?
So I can get my job back.
Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
Say hi to Paul.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
So what's the time?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
That's where the what comes in.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
What time is it?
Eight-thirty.
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
I just did.
Absolutely. We would be honored.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Good thinking.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
Carl Heine's type.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
You're wondering why I held it.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
I should show them an American?
Does it now?
You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
I already said that, b...
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
Beat it, Buster.
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
Fresh!
A what?
My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.
Where were you guys?
Yeah.  Why?
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
We're not too late, are we?
As far away as possible.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
Me?  After Sugar?
Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.
Jerry - there's another problem.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
Joe -
What?
Get me Room 414.
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
I'm Sugar Cane.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
That's ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
What for?
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
What's the big idea?
We could dye our hair.
We could -
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Help yourself.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
I'll throw up!
Why not?
It doesn't matter.
I forgive you.
And I can never have children.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
My car?  Why, you -
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
It's not the backs that worry me.
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Where did he conduct?
Me?
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
You're entitled.
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
Why not?
Want to switch berths with me?
Would you mind terribly?
Not at all.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
I'm not interested at all.
You're society girls?
- Inauguration balls -
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
You collect shells?
Shell Oil?
Shells?  Whatever for?
They shrink when they're marinated.
Bon voyage.
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
What thing?
You mean - like frigid?
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
What else is there for me? 
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
I know.  Every time!
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
I cut myself shaving.
You don't owe me no nothing.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Bacardi 151.
You are taking the piss?
What?
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Nothing, nothing.
No, I cant. Were late for a dance lesson. I guess youll have to finish up later.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Kat, stop it. You do. You cant even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
I think thats disgusting.
I have a friend at the magazine.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
First of all, its never out of the blue. And second of all--
What?!
Yup. Thats why you get to keep your money.
Its my job.
Make out with you for free.
Yeah.
Hi.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Is there any other way to take it?
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
It was too dark, Daddy.
Yes, sir...
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
Goodnight to you, son...
No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
David!
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Same as we -- they pray.
Children, come here...
Can I go when the holiday comes?
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
Did you find your father?
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
They probly thought you was crazy.
Whatcha got there?
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
I hate the environment.
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
That book wasn't Canadian!
I saw him last night!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Your behind?
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
I don't know.
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
MPH RM!!!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
MOM!!!
Uhh... I don't know.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
What about air strikes?
No, it was worse than that...
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Don't call me dumb!
Wendy?
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days.  Dry up into crunchy little pinkies.
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
Oh Sara...
Anna...
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
I'm sure I will.
Oh he did, did he?
My...wings...
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
You better start making sense!
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
I understand.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
Helllp!
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
Taylor!  Where are you?
How does the distress signal look?
And so far.
Try not to think about it.
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
I'm from Akron.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
That game was before you was born.
It's mine.
I ain't nobody's father!
I'm your blood.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
You're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
I never saw you.
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
Hello, mom?
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
What did you do to Buzz?
You know who I am?
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Where did your brother escape from?
No. Do You?
So, what about you?
Why were you suspended?
He said he'd sponsor me.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
What's plan C?
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
I could let them go for ten.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
...lane six. Yes.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
He's dead Sheila.
Lips still for sale?
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
Fletcher, I want you back here.
It's burning...
I can't...
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
What if it attacks?
It's either that or we grow gills.
The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
Press?  No, I haven't.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
Extraordinary, isn't it?
It doesn't make any sense.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Edmunds?  Can you copy?
But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
Then how can it be chipped?
Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
Too big?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
That's quite a secret.
Wait -- down where?
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Yeah.  Drowning.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
Get this thing off me.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
So what?
Don't tell me to calm down!
Don't do this.
Don't bother me, Norman.
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
Page 87.  "I could never read that far."
I don't know.
No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
Ephedrine hydrochloride.
How do you spell it?
It's a soporific.
What do you mean, different?
How's Harry?
Don't you?
No, he can't.
Shut up, Beth --
Don't you know?
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
For who?  The fish?
Another attack?
Yes you are...
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Fine.  I'm fine.
No, why don't --
So what?
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
What noise?
Then explain it to me.
What are they?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
What happened to her?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
You didn't say that about the food?
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
I heard!  I heard!
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Wait!
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
Do you?
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Not that I know of.  Why?
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
This isn't a game, you know.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
I'll make a report later.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
What are you saying?
Why didn't you say so before.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
I'd consider it an honor.
I didn't see him !
He was our teacher... He was great.
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
I have good reflexes.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Carl can wait.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
Aw, don't get mushy.
Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
Who is V'ger?
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
May I ask Why?
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Twelve seconds...!
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Aye, sir.
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>    
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Helm ready, sir.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Go you Huskies?
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
Why?
But why the dalmation?
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
I live there.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
Later on.
Then I'll come back, then.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
Because I'd met someone else.
I can't get it to come out right.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Going home.
Did as of last week.
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
But that's what happened.
But it'll stop the movie.
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
Who is this person that you've found?
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
Fifteen hands.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
That Could Be.
She wasn't in the...
Nothing happened.
Bourbon and Milk.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
I swear that that woman in my room...
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
You have to what?
Who is her agent...?
<u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom?
Look, look there's someone else...
I...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
We, we have to give it.
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
He treated me as if I were a child...
Bob are you alright...?
Marty...
I'll put the, in your r...
Yes.
She won't stop crying...
-- she's got 'religion.'
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
What is the...?
Arrest him.
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
He told you that...
Mmmm.  You have children?
My wife just went into labor...
He saw the girl in the car...
Not now.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
You want me to lie.
I have to tell the truth.
I...
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
How are you getting on with these fine people?
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
<u>Find</u> it.
Is he cool or angry?
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
...the city council...
Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
You think so?
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
That will never happen.
Then why are you putting on mascara?
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
I'll be there for you.
Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
You have to ignore him.
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
Why don't you say hello?
That doesn't bother me.
No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
In high school.
You owe me a quarter.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Is that like Luigi's?
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
That's Rache's song!
Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Where Ben?
Ben where do you have to get to?
Half.  Of him.
Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
Easy enough.
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
Not to me.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
To make it easier for them or you?
WE are over.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
We're going to win this.
Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
We don't have any coffee.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
But it's not on the schedule!
Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I need practice.
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
She was angry at herself.
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
We can't live like that.
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
How's she doing with Brad?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
We have to talk.
Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
But?  But what?
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Yes.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
My baby.
You have a bay?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
What?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Just the same.
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
You're welcome.  Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Say, 'Nigger.'
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Yeah.
Great. How old are they?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Doubt it.
Whoopee.
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Oh.
Y-yes--
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
We're outta here--
We don't have time!
What happened!
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
What are you talking about?
Are you going to kill us?
I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
I insist...
She's as good as gone...
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
How much do they have?
What!
Dissent?
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
Possibly some coffee?
Moffo!
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Look, I didn't shoot him!
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.
What kind of trouble?
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
Condition Red!
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Plan-R????
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Thank you, sir.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
You're damned right they are.
That's close enough, Major.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Naturally I am, sir.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Maybe it's an exercise.
Speed?
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Look, can't someone help me?
I've got one.
What's your point, Lothar?
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Master Kong.
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way.
Why should they call us back?
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
But I get a red light.
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
Sure, King.
Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Yup.
Right now?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Needs some pizza in his diet.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No. Life is too short.
Sure.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Wait, what happened to the tree?
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Am I fucking him?
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Yeah?
You better! Yes!
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
What'd he get you?
Oh, yeah?
Mm.
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
Thank you.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
That chick, Erica?
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Just go home, alright?
I don't know.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
I don't know.
You do.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
God, you smell like whiskey.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Where are you going?
For a ride.
Shit, Jeff!
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Go.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
So how's college?
What?
Yeah, really.
Now?
Well, not exactly.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Of course it does.
Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Look at you!
I can't believe you're still here.
If...
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Whatever.
Don't do that.
If you hit me...
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
So where are you?
No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."
That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
You sure I'm not fat?
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
But you're not married.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
My what?
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
I'll take it.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
I don't want it now.
This is where you live?
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
We've missed you too, dear.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
And you'll play Salome?
This is fascinating.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
What's wrong with It?
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
I don't need a tuxedo.
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
The other guests?
What's that?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
I think I'll read a little.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
No, they don't.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
That's what I told them.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Softball.
Have fun.
What do you mean we?
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
Maybe it was just an accident.
When can I see, you again ?
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
We have to have a long talk about all this.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Let me kiss you.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
She'll forget about us eventually.
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
I'll drink to that.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
Yeah.
As brave as my father. As wise.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
Must've been a defective puck.
It was just a trim.
It doesn't seem right.
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
What? Me?
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
I have to talk to you.
You're wasting your breath.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
A cheap trick.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
For what?
I was on Earth...
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
I know.
Criminals.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
Nope.  Never. 
I seem to be.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
There's a lot of choices here.
Well, aren't you excited?
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Kent!
Oh?
At one o'clock in the morning?
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!

That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
Who gets it, the company?
So where is all them half-centses?
Just the man I wanted to see!
I did. isn't it neat-o?
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
We've already got some.
What will it get me?
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
I didn't have my camera with me.
It was hot!
Anytime.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
But the bridge...
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
You've got to pick three more numbers.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
We already have a super-tanker.
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Lois, you're amazing.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
How could you win a crazy bet like --
What??
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
 DELETE IN CUTTING
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
What shall we do now?
Stay. I will come to you.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
I'm not so sure you do.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Who?
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
There!
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
What?
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
This wasn't in the plan.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
You are . . .
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
We're running out of smoke.
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
I will.
'Swell.' When  was the last time I heard anybody say  -  where are you from , anyway?
Oh.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
This??
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
I knew you'd hit me.
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
I mean the other one!
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
He sure as heck does that.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
Enjoyed it?
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
I guess they are a little odd.
Do you like pink?
I...uh...check.
It is for me.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
Yes...fine.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Which one?
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
Was it good?
Yeah.
And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
Oh.  Right.
It does concern me.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
They can look forward to that.

From what?
The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
What's that, Dolores?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
Well, winter's far behind us now.
It's the truth.
It's like a song.
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Oh.
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
You seem very sure about that.
That's the local bar?
Indian?
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Yes.
I need money.
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
Excuse me?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Yes.
Yes.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
The ramp?
No.
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
I don't know.
Will the police do anything to her?
See my mother?
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
I don't believe it.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
I didn't say that, J.J.
Are you finished?
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
And who's feet is she on now?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Why give her real proof?  You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, J.J., - but she almost followed him out the window.  What do you want - a chronic invalid?
- He's got them on him.
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
You're sure.  Find out for me.
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
What sort of thing?
- that's what I mean!
But...
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
I can't
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
No way!
Can I stop by my house?
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
You will.
Pain causes it?
No!  Don't kill him!
I love you, John.  I always have.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
No.
And Skynet fights back.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
'Dim-shits'?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
What museum?
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
I would like to go now, please.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
It's the truth.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
Go ahead, be my guest.
Von der Null?
Yes, von der Null.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Me? Never.  Never.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
How could I know what's in the archive?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
How could I forget?
Show you?
What?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
One of my people?
His private life?
Nope.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
Don't wear the beige one.
You must have a girlfriend.
I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Molecular-memory.
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Don't say that.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Someone?
A girl.  You know.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
What?
Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?"  He's gone sailing, Alan.  He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
It was an accident.
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
He's turning blue!
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
How do you know that's the way?
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
I don't spend much time looking out the window.  I'll call you a taxi.
They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
Come here...
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
Not here!  They can see.
Get out of my car!
They did the same to him as they did to you.
That's not true...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
I didn't know what else to call you.
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Yes.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
This isn't an escort service?
Who?
Yeah, almost...
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
It always is.
I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
No, thank you.
Oh... it's a game.
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Goodnight then.
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
His behavior... ?
Look, where is he?!
No.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Follow me.
<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
Sure.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Maybe someday.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
I got more scared.
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Who?
No one will come any nearer than that.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
Well?
Not for you, clearly.
What kind of food?
Why?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
Who?
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Not bad.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
We'll find him.
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Terry Valentine.
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
One thing I need.
He's gotta know why.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Not much -- you?
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
How d'you mean?
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
Where you get your bank statements.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
What line is he in.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Who remembers.
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
I don't believe it.
Pushing the legal limit even then.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
He alive to see this?
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
Up the coast.
How far?
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
He had urgent business in the north.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
I got half.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
You know I don't live with him.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
Ah.
Uh--
That right.
I can get it, yeah.
Sure.
Ed.
Sure.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
...I don't think so.
Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
So... who... who actually--
Taking it seriously.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
Yeah, yeah--go home.
...You ever wonder about it?
What the hell are you talking about?
You also have an interest in the securing property?
Yeah--
Yeah?
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Homicide.
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
What's the combination?
Let's go!
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
Dr. Green has to see you!
Not so loud.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
They're eggs.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
Read it out loud.
"Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates.  You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days.  So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded.  We've made an incredible find.  I enclose a representation of Mbwun.  Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate.  I know because I've seen the beast."
Yes, I do.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Quiet.
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
How about lunch?
How did you know that?
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
They're all heavily armed.
What was it?
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
The planetarium!
How?
The answer's right in front of us.
Oh God!  Help!
That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
Do it!
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments.  Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
I know.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
I think I'd like a little company.
There's been an accident, Truman.
Do something...
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.
It looks so small.
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Yes.
Agent Mulder.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Of what?
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
I'm looking for him.
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
Have you examined them?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
I'll know soon enough.
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
How's that?
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
I just did. You're buying.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
What? What are you talking about?
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
Evidence of a massive infection.
And you've never seen anything like that?
-- of what exactly?!
This virus -- it... 
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Come on!
I think... something stung me.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
I don't know anything about that.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
Where's Scully?!
How deep does this go?
I've got to find Scully.
You're lying.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
And Mulder?
He needs to be turned over.
I'll be fine.
No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right?
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Little boy?!  That's him!
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
's broken.
I bet we can fix it.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
I don't have to.
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
Do you understand German?
I was told there were only two men there.
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Tell me more.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
Anna.
It's all right.
I don't know.
A parrot...Let it go.
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
I shall be all right.
Of course.
They're Harry's.
He works in a military hospital.
Two weeks ago.
They are - private - letters.
He was...
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
I'm not asking you to.
You all did.
Take him to Sacher's.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
Certainly.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
I want to talk to you.
Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Why not?
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
Coming to the point, please.
I have guests waiting.
Not necessarily.
English?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
Yes.
What else?
Richard. Hi.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
Here.
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Eh - bonsoir.
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
Where did you lose it?
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
Let's look at the fucking thing.
Why the fuck not?
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
Are they still together?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
No.
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
That's stupid.
It looks a little like a swastika.
What's it about?
Don't curse in front of it.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
Nothing. Let's go....
I'm stealing it.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
It's the truth....
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Why?
Female...
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
Give me a reason not to.
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
What were you, following me?
The arguments, anyway.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
This is me.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
But I wasn't.
Daniel Balint.
It's German.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
They're not my people....
Isn't it true?
What...?
Shut up...
How?
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
Exactly.
Eat shit....
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Yes.
No.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
Italian is practically the same thing.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Hello!
Yes.
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
What was he like, when he was little?
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
You know what I'm talking about.
I dive in search of God.  If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Dollars.
Then tell him to wax it too.
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
He's training.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
I don't want to erase anything.
Thank you.
It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know?
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
Lucky I was there to save you.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
You'll try again tomorrow?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
I brought Johana to meet you.
He doesn't hear too well.
How was your trip?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
In the spring when he melts!
What's your first move?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
Yes Esther.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
We go to the same temple.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
That depends. How much money has he?
Good looking?
And when you drink, you get drunk.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
That's right, of course.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
More or less.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Just barely possible - - yes.
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith  teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
They do, but -- there are no lights out there - they'll just be shadows -
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
No - not yet.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
Now look what you've done.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
I don't know  a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
Must it?
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Paul Lamont...?
When did you get back?
Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
My brother hung himself.
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
Is there anything to understand?
Simplify and damn.
Dont you believe in simplicity?
The dead can wait.
Youre a long way from home...
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
A criminal?
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For gods sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Tomorrow?
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
Well, Im sorry. I...  This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. Ive got the week off and hes come to stay.
Your secretary, huh!
Carlos De Moraes?
What if it is?
Recommended?
Must I speak to you in French?
My rates...
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education.
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
Le Mercury. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Good reasons?
Im afraid I dont understand.
Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse...  And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions...
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
What about his girlfriend?
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Would you know where I might reach her?
Three...
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Cost what?
Costliest!
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Better today than tomorrow.
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Come with me...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
Do as I say!
That's an order!
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
And?
To avoid killing anyone.
Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
I understand.  How much?
If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference.  It might be a trap...  Look... Signed "X".  What sort of name is "X"?  Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
... as always, majesty...
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Oh?  Perhaps someone pushed you then?
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
If you kill him, you kill me!
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
I agree...
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
No, I...
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
Only God knows the answer to that.
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
Who are you?
Just over a year.
What's happened?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Thanks.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
That's also my business.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
Otherwise what?
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
Yes, so did the Germans.
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Cow!
God forbid!
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
Szpilman.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
To be deaf?
Like it were a piano?
No sound at all?
Oh indeed. Cotton'.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
I'll be back.
What for?
Spoken words?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
It's my mother's piano.
Play a song then
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
What's the line on Visitation?
Billie.  You ready?
No, no cops!
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
What do we do?
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
We'll be waitin'.
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
Neither are we.
If we ever get to it.
Did he say he wouldn't?
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.
Pass.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
All right, when?
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
What do you mean?
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
No.
Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
Why not?
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Dorothy!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
You're high enough.
No.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
Then what are you hiding?
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Yes.
There. 
He's been dead for three months.
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
Yes, she would.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
That woman!
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Nunheim!
This is enough for me.
Extraordinarily lucky.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
He did!
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
Let him have his say out.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
All right.  All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
Just what I said I'd do.
I don't like him.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
Never mind.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
I didn't knock Julia off.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
That last Martini.
Take it easy.
Can't you get to sleep?
I'll get some towels. 
No.  It's a Christmas present.
You must admit I have good taste.
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
Nick!
That's a fact.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
I wish you'd tell me who.
Why are you saying it?
How did you get in here?
Yes.  Nick!
Home!
I'm fired.
Who fired you?
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
I heard!
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
Why'd he come in our camp.
We're at war.
What about Jaeger?
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Knock it off!
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
We're going to be right over here.
That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
He's not going to leave us.
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
Jesus, Jaeger.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
I don't want to die.
Don't you touch it.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
I don't have a weapon.
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Then I'm a rich man.
Yeah.
Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
People are suffering.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Yeah, you're funny.
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
That's in two days.
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
Oh, no.
How the hell should I know how much?
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
You want to say some words?
Correct.  Origin?
triple three, triple three! easy.....
No, Tetanty.
What's the matter with you?
I don't want to lose you.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
We're leaving.
But you can't.  We must escape.
Impossible!
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
I don't feel well.
When?.....How?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
You don't know that!
Look more closely.
You should know better than that!
No thanks, Bev.
Drive.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Bingo!
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Would you?
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
IRA - instant retirement account.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
And diamonds in the front.
Yes.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
Well--then it must be my mistake.  I beg your pardon.
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
Just dull.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Doc--!
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Very well, m'sieu.
Ah!
Yes!  Now don't worry!
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Yes.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
What?
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
It's disgraceful!
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Then a little nap--
Correct!  Good night.
Like that?
You're conceited--
But I don't want to be a lady.
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock.
To me he seems rather nervous.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
For all the really important things--
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
But you saw it here.
Get that outta my face.
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
Well I can.
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
Sssshh. Come here.
This is crazy.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
I'll be right back.
We'll find out.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
Excuse me.
It's so unfair.
I never want to go back....
That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
Oh--a hundred times--
Will you leave me alone?
Glad to see you again.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
Montana?
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
<U>Gladly</U>.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
What did you want a gun for?
Not at all.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Very much--
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
You work too fast for me, young man.
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
Married?
Don't be a c-a-t.
Yes?
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
But--
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You mean that?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
I'll be waiting on deck.
What's the matter?
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
--there's thousands of 'em!
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
No, sir?
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
<U>Me</U>!
On the drunk.
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
I'll go with you--
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
Sure.
So what?
I thought I put you to bed.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Like it?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
No--not much--excepting-- 
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
What do you mean?
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Well, let's hear the poem--
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
What's he got that I haven't got?
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
Thanks to me.
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
Because I was yellow, I guess--
Good night!
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
I'll explain later--
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Yes, very.  And very married.
Oh, so that's it...
Beauty, ain't he?
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
But who was the Devil?
Ignore her?
Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Sorry...
Not half as bad as I feel.
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Room service.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
Always?
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
I need it.
Well in that case, I saw your Horse.  Billy Clanton was takin' Him up to the Cut to show him Off.  The boys're all up there Right now, branding.  And in a Mood.  Still want your property Back, Mr. Private Citizen?
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
Morg, use your head.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
That a fact?
Yeah.  It's a fact.
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
We'll see about that.
I'm on my way.
What about the gold?
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Where can I find him?
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
- Four wheel drive?
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
Hey - the world is my office.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
I'll keep that in mind.
- You're not.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
I didn't say when I want to die -
And number two?
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
Start the grinders.
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Yes.
That's a lie.
We got the same thing.
Oh here we go with that.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
What is it, noontime?
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
It was nip and tuck.
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra?  Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up.  What would you give to be rich?
You all act like two roosters.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I will appreciate that.
You must have been really sick.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't.  You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
Where is Skip?
Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Bye, house.
Woody!  Buzz!
Rocky!  The ramp!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
No, you can't.
That's why.  Sid.
Trouble?!  Where?!
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Well, then let's climb abroad.
Don't tell me what to do!
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Yeah, right.
Not today!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
I can't see a thing!
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
Oh no, Hannah!
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
Home is where the heart is.
What about school?
Go away.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
You're only a young thing.
Living with him put years on me.
Can you move over a wee bit?
Juliet who?
It's all right, Finn.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
How much?
I want to believe you.  I really do.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
What?
Carl, that's insane.
Carl --
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
Is this bad for him?
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
Helena --
How long's the job?
Like I give a fuck.
Depends who it's from.
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA.  Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search.  The odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds.  We hire drivers with nothing to lose.  Then we throw a lot of product at the problem.  Some get stopped.  Enough get through.  It's not difficult.
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
I don't think you're going to do that.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Who?
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now.  Are you all right?
Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
It's where I live.
Eh-
Shut up.
Right. You can't sleep here.
Smells like it.
You're too young.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
But try too hard --
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
So who else?
Yeah.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Are you serious?
Your usual table, sir?
In that case --
You'll have to send us a postcard.
Such as?
It's fresh air.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
So what's it going to be?
What?
But where?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
It could. Yes.
It runs deep. Share it with me.
Closing.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Transporter room. Status.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
Captain, what have I done -
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
How do you know?
Uh-uh.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
I don't control minds. I free them.


He's not?
No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
I hide no pain.
I know you better than that.
I cannot go with you.
I don't understand...
Are you embezzling?
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Okay, okay...
Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Well, isn't it -- ?
Wrote the...?
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
It grows on you.
Come here.
Whew. You never were much for small talk.  She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
But-what if I can't...?
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
Yeah.  You know Harry.
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
In the helicopter.
In her dreams.
I still don't believe it.
Yeah, but for who?							*
He could be working her to get to you.
What are you talking about?
You tell on me, I tell on you.
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Yes what?
Oral hygiene?
Me too.
Good thinking, honey.
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
Yes.
Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
I don't take those assignments.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Do you still love me?
Dance?
Those idiots.
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
You'll call me then?
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Hello, Alabama.
Yes.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
How come?
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Don't eat anything.
Get it.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
What time is it?
'Bout twelve.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
What do you do?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
Who and what is a Drexl?
A real live pimp?
Uh-huh.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
What?
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
I just gotta get somethin'.
How come?
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
Heard that.
So you do eat pussy!
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
She's with me.
Tomorrow.
Now tell him goodbye.
Is he big league?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Where?
What's to think about?
In case.
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
Who's Sonny Chiba?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
They'll be along.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
That good, huh?
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Who is he?
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
You do.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
Rock whores.
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
Just put it in your purse.
No.
Do you live here?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
So that...???
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
A jail?  Prison?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Hey, man...
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
You want something, old man?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
What do you want for free?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
Nothing.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
No it won't.  You just don't know shit about statistics.
Where to?
How much.
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Twenty-after-ten.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
There you go, sweet talking me again.
Open up!
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
What's it to you?
Kirin?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Yeah, I'll try.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
Can't I?  You're out in the desert, all alone, with a body in your trunk.  What do you think, boy?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
What does it look like?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You love him?
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
I can't.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
Lied?  What do you mean?
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
Is it so bad?  It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
What about us?
Stop it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Give him the money.
It's our money.  He had no right to take it.
Just drive.
But I want to say with you,
Where the hell am I going to go?
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
I'm her husband.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Would I what?
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
Talk?  About what?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
Shut up.
Came close this time and it scares you.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Christ, Jake, please--
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
Not from where I stand.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You expect me to believe that?
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
They're not very imaginative?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Not before I settle with you.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
The old lady?
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
But, Senor--
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Christ no!
That a fact?
What do you want for free?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Oh, shit!
An overheated car.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
You're talking like a madman.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
What makes you say that?
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
No!
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
What the hell are you talking about?
What's your name anyway?
He's up at the Look Out.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Great!
How much!?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
You believe that?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Open up!
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
You should be more careful.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Where you headed?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Is that why you're with him?
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
You could leave him.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
My mother died in this canyon.
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
They look nice.
No! No! Please!
Wow.
What about Jeb?
Oh shit...
Jesus.
It's finished. I won.
I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
Are you for real?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
No Jeremy.
I'm not scared.
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Building his porch!
Maybe he ain't so tough.
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Yeah. See?
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Be careful with those, sonny.
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Yup.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
They really got all that money, them whores?
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Oh.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
I got him.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Yup.
Yeah.
I can't see 'em.
Just SHOOT!
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
Huh?
Eleven.
Two weeks, I guess.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed.
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
Easy, Bill.
You gonna share your half with him?
I don't like the question.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
We done that stuff.
Just like that?
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
They'll never stop.
I love you.
They ruined me tonight.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
You okay?
No killing?
We'll make it.
What time is it?
Mr. Soze will be most -
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
I shivved him.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Did they charge him with anything?
What'the fuck is that?
Two hours, tops.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
He didn't have my lawyer.
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
No.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
Give a guy a break, huh?
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
I never heard of him.
NO.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
How good's your intelligence?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
... tell me about this case.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth.  He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye.  You meet him at the hospital.'
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
Yes.
That's right.
Well, we...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
I'm just an M.D.
How is that?
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
You may step down.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
Hold on a second.
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
'Code Blue'...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
That's what I'd planned to...
...What difference would...
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Yes.  I wrote it.
And you wrote that...
Yes.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Thank you for seeing me.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
Yes.  Price...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
And are they going to get it?
That's what I'm going to try to do.
No, no, I'm just...
I've got to work.
Well, then what are you doing here?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
Uh ...
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... now who is that ...?
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
Right.
The Doctors.
Read me what she said.
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
She told me.
In New York?
You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Who told you that?
That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh.  And why is that?
So far you're great.  You got a cigarette?
Me, too.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Someone dead.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
There are things you didn't tell me.
But you knew about this.
And when she goes to those places...
What happened?
Did she hurt herself?
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
Dinner... and what else?
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Yes.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
We're going up the tower.
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
No...
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Some people prefer it.
No... it's wrong.
No birds live here.
Here with you.
...somewhere in the light.
Yesterday.
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
No!
All the time.
Tell me.
Yes.
Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
I'm having one now.
Oh!
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Three whole weeks.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
What I've been doing?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
Well...
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Multiple reasons.
I don't know why the floor was wet!
The hell I don't.
And you're a little fucking reject.
You're a loser.
You fucking bastard!
I'm calling the ambulance.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
What?
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
So that's what we're doing.
Don't talk to me about character.
I can't do this.
I don't give a damn.
I got children. I've got a life.
They're singing.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
I know and I'm honored...
What happened? Oh my God...
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Who's up for making some real money?
Shut up.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
He is not cracking up.
I said, what have we done?
I just want to get married.
Just do it.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
I never heard that.
False.
Not true.
New king.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
There's my point exactly.
Take Mexico.
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
You will not screw this up.
Are we supposed to?
Sent it.
You forgot the tent?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
I wouldn't know.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
Right before the wedding?
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Why? What's his problem?
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
You will not be common!!!
I'm not. What's the problem?
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
What okay?
The chairs.
Now?
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
What money?
Move the bodies?
But...
I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
The wahoo?
Greenpeace?
Downstairs in the closet.
Did he try to kiss you?
The post-Vegas Man.
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
That's right.
Two.
Then it's a respectable house.
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Come down.
Never.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ...
You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Are you Jorge?
Leave him alone.
I'll be ready.
He couldn't get through the door, then?
But, miss ...
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Their weapons missing?
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
I need your help--
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
What's wrong with Parker?
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Of course you are.
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
I've been in prison, remember?
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
As a matter of fact, it is.
Relax. I know what you meant.
This isn't a game, Parker!
I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
You like baseball?
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...
Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent.  We bring'em back <u>tomorrow</u>, the charts go up, they don't go <u>down</u>...
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> Bomb.  Ooookay.  It's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA.
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
King, we've got to be on the streets in...
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
It won't hold.
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
<u>Do</u> it...
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
Yes
<u>Who</u>?
What do you know about them?
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
...uh huh...
Knock on wood.
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
Where's my pill...?
WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
Remember the Maine...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
Why Albania?
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
They got to have something that we want.
"Freedom."
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
...it's a Teaser!
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
President's speech.
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
Where is he now?
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
...<u>isn't</u> it?  Hey, what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Uh...
An anti-psychotic...
You got a dime....?
Get on the phone, have'em fly in a ...whaddaya need to be a citizen?  A Judge?  Whaddaya need?  A Judge...? Call in a <u>Judge</u>, call in a Federal <u>Judge</u>, and...  If you're concerned about him, being an ..."immigrant." Make him a <u>citizen</u>... Eh?  <u>Guys</u> ... what's all this <u>mopery</u>, we...
...one more day.
Watch me.
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
When do you bring'em back?  Schumann.
Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me.
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
I believe in you....
Jim Belushi...?
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
"...the special detachment..." Good!  What is it?
...who <u>are</u> you?  Who <u>are</u> you sonofabitches... 
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
a "pond," or
Please, no thanks... 
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
...if I had your looks, better.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
What are you doing here?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
Yeah, right...
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
No sir, that would've been illegal...
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
What makes you think you can?
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
You could have a great beach house for that.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.
Why?
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
He still likes you
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
Businessman?
Yeah 
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Can I give her a message?
Who's is all this?
Right.
Six six and six
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
YES!
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
How do you know it's a she?
What does she look like?
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
Yes, but...
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
Oh-kay...
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
Wait!  Don't go...
Right.  I'm sorry.
No, I don't.
She never mentioned her father.
Stop.
You are?
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Absolutely.
M-E...
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Adamant?
After that.
To make sure she's all right.
Did you call the police?
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
Norman...
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
We had a seance.
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Claire, please...
Yep.
I felt you...looking through me...
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
MADISON!
But you've not told Michael.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
Come.  There is a lot to read
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Then you wear it.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
Lie...?
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
I LOVE him!
I love Michael...
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
Rowan...
My jury's still out on that,
And whose houses do you design...?
Mad. for each other.
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
Mm-hmmm...
I love you too.
Talking to me dear...?
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
Tell me - ELLEN CARTER  Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book - 'The Color of Fear'?
And how many people have you killed?
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
Yes I can...
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
Yes, come on in...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
You and your pep talks.
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Astronomical.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
Not ever. Never.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
We reinvented ourselves.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Well. The prom's coming up.
But that smile.
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
Hi ho, Silver.
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
My legacy.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
My room?
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
You never know around here.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
He didn't. He had it built.
It's all so complicated.
Well? Where the hell are you?
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
Maybe someday.
You're quick. I like that.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
He was in a league of his own.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
Bad news.
I'm just a messenger.
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
Kelly.
Thanks.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
Eliminate the competition.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
And what do they say?
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
Shit.
I'm not on your property!
Hi, Mon.
Sam!  Hi!
No thanks to you.
No you don't.
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
In back of the garage.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
Do it to ourselves?
Duquette.  Forget him...
No little girl can ever make me come.
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
The one you bought at school.
Yes.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Jim West.
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
That's right... That's good.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
It's a town!
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
I'm sure we will.
Yes, me!
Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
You tell me.
Philistine.
It is?
In an hour they're gone!
Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
You are very important, Willow.
You're not a woman.
Say what?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
I will.
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
That's all I ever wanted!
Why?
Queen Cherlindrea?
Who??
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Milking?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
Just do it!
Yes, sir.
Who'd you see?
What are you going to do?
Have you got your gun on now?
Sure have, Sam.
Amish.
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
Home.
Can I have something to drink?
Only the elders.
But you can't.
You tell him. When you're able.
Hochmut?
Oh. The bullets.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
It won't happen again.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
No? Why not?
I don't think she knows.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
No --
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
To see?
If she?
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Catch him, you fool!
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Me?
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Oh --
Oh, my! 
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
You're right -- I am a coward.
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Oh --
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Ohhh --
Where's Kansas?
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Oh --
Yes --- there.
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Leave her alone!
Ah --
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Who at?
Yeah. Me?
That's right.
This way!  Come on!
Yeah!
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Whozat?
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
Not nohow!
Ohhhhhh!
To Oz?
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Ho -- ho --ho
It's a whozis?
Now, now, don't fret.
We'll get you together!
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Yes.
Yes -- ....
Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.
Alright then, brunch.
Elektra King.
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
I took the initiative.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Id do the same again.
The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
Youre not going to.
Its the only way out...
...you should rest.
I have to go to work.
Really?
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
What?  This is not possible.
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
A rope!
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
What class sub does your nephew run?
C-class.
Could...could you come?
Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Why?  What's the problem?
Please.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Maybe not, but why take chances?
You're sure?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
You and me.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
I don't know their real names.
Please.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Ever see one of these before?
Looks like a diner.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Is that a fact?
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Who says you're the good guys?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
"Anarchy" 99"?
Yorgi asked me to.
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
We hung out last night, remember?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
You can't talk to it?
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
When else are you gonna do it?
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
Had to do what I had to do.
Its core?
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
How?
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
I know.
It does indeed, Max.
From your office, sir.
What?
Baack!
Of course.
I promise.
Oh, nice.
You're incorrigible!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
Yes, sir.
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
I see.
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
How do you do?
The wockers with the knockers.
Did you hear that strange music?
Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
I have a pretty good idea.
All right... elevate me!
This guy means business.
More, do you hear me?
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
It wasn't me.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
It's alive!
How's everything?
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
And look at this, Doctor!
Raise the platform, hurry!
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Stop -- singing!!!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
