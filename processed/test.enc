You have my word.  As a gentleman
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Have fun tonight?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
The "real you".
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Who?
Queen Harry?
Neat...
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
Why didn't you tell me?
Oh, God.  It's starting.
I was kidding. People actually live there?
How many people were in your old school?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
What'd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Where ya goin?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
What?
How'd you do it?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
What's this?
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
And why would I do that?
Are you following me?
What's this?
You're not okay.
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Why'd you let him get to you?
You 're so --
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Is that right?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Which parts?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
What?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Tumescent!
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
No...
I'm not bargaining!
All I have to do is call the guards.
Chief knows.
Chief says -- he has a God.
That's what it says.
How can you be so certain?
Esdras is a Jew.
I am listening, my son.
I suppose we're both old men now.
Do they have such thoughts?
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
And what do you think Mendez?
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
What else do you need?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
It was my decision, not his.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
What was that, Korfin?
Vodka tonic.
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Takin' a bath.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Are you hit?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Nah, why should you?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
I'm serious here.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
That's good.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Are you married?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Yes.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Don't fool around.
Get in the bathroom!
Let me get a shot of it.
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
You got that?
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
New York.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
What are you coming here to do?
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
That's what it looks like to me.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
I used an accelerant.
Yeah?  What kind?
He knew all along.
How was it?
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Well, that's something.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is.
The antenna has to be replaced.
CONTINUED
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Thank you, Daddy.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Certainly.
Any clue as to what it is?
Any ideas about the colour?
What do you mean?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
I will if I can, Frank.
That's true
Roger.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Where's ganz?
You lying son of a bitch...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Yeah?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
There.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Where's the money?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah?
How did they get away?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
So do you...been a long day.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
That's the way I see it, too.
Thanks for the coffee.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
Hey, I don't believe it.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Where is he?
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Shut up.
How ya doin'?
Surprise, Luther.
Let her go.
Rosalie, you okay?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
What're you laughing about?
I brought the girl remember?
So you do know her.
What are you doing?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Where's Leeloo?
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
So, just how big was this fare?
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
...Hello?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Where you going?
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Actually only one cell survived..
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Am I disturbing you?
...Not far, now.
How's our deal coming along?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Hello?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
I don't know what to say
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
I'm camera shy.
What are these for?
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
... sorry...
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Where?  Show me where.
Don't think I won't.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Enlighten me.
Yeah... guess so.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
How much do you make now?
I don't know, where are yours?
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
You don't need to be here.
Uh huh, pleasure.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
I told you I can't, not yet.
I'm here.
Hello?
Yes... ?
Yes.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
We're all like that.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Will you let me look?
Hello... ?
What are you talking about... ?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Rick...I can't.
I'm sure they're around.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
About Freddy?
What's wrong with me?
What is it?
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
Is that who you're waiting for?
Hi, beautiful.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
Dad!
How was the meeting?
I've got to go.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
Mark, are you okay?
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
Yes?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
Cyclops?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Well?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Under <u>water</u>?
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Yeah. I know about that.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You played for the Sox?
Don't mind if I do.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
No, I mean whereabouts.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
To us it was.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
What do you want, then?
Where's the plow?
You mean Twombley?
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
How you holding up, Wade?
So?
Want to buy?
I won't. You interested?
Could be.
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
I still don't understand --
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
For a while.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
You've been married twice --
Alright. I'll think about it.
Think they're alright?
This is nuts.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Take care, Wade.
His office. You mean my old office.
Sleeping.
Wade?
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
You think Jack shot him?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Which is?
Then who shot him?
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
I'm sure he's busy.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Daddy...
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
How we doing, Colonel?
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
We don't know that.
I prefered the terrorists.
But they start executing hostages in
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Why?
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
Stand by.
What do you know of my husband?
Why? Do you enjoy it?
No.
Four...
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Finally, we can bargain.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
You give me ulcers.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
Te...!
Who's that, Ted?
Elaine, we have to go back.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Not now, Elaine.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Sure.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
What?
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Yes.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
All right, it's a matter of death.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
No. No one that I know of.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Rats! I've lost number three.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
See them, Elaine?
Airsick?
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
He's not here.  Why ask me?
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
William Harcourt?
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
What's this?  What's going on?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Tell me.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
I'm going home.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Only holds five.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
How can I go?
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
I'll go.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
No.  There's no way!
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
That the atmosphere processor?
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Corporal Hicks!?
Now, wait a second --
How do you feel?
Alive?
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Sounds like you, Hicks.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Wah...?  Where are...?
How many colonists?
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Where?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
What?
You were sublime.
What?
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
I want to go back to Vienna.
Yes!
Where?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Tish-I'm-tee.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Don't be stupid.
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Wolfi!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Oh, Stanzi.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
I can't write it!
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
Oh, yes.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Be careful!
He's adorable!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
What a strange young man.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
Who was your teacher?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Do you like this, Salieri?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
That's not what I hear.
Yes.
How many?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
What medicine?
Yes?
Yes.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Ah!
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
Whom did they choose?
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
You flatter me.
I do.
Strange!
Do you have me?
Do you want to rest a bit?
I am so ashamed.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
I do not seek forgiveness.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Did you try?
I poisoned his life.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Yes?
Yes.
Where?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
What did he say?
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
I was. What are you reading?
How old are you?
My best friend. My very best friend.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
What?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I would think so.
Bathroom.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
I've left those pills for you.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
But...
How are we feeling tonight?
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Oh, come on, tell us.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
I really don't know.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
You're talking about the woman I love.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Nice looking group.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Right.
Say, David...
Come on, where?
See anything?
Jack?
Yeah.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
It's you, David.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
Hello.
Dr. Hirsch?
Then you have some hot tea?
No.
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Yes - sure
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Whose death?
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
And tell him not to delay.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
What good will that do?
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Thanks.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
John, how's your wife this morning?
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
I don't know.
Good morning, Helen.
Yes, thank you.
You haven't got a uniform?
I already told him I was home.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
What time did this thing happen?
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
He's at a board meeting.
Matt, come here!
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Well . . . ?
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Uhh, yeah it does.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
How?
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
Swear.
He's not bad at it.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
Sorry.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
We'll make them pay for this.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Jesse.
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
Boys...
Such as?
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Bob's upset.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Jim was old enough...
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
How much of that story is true?
Not if I find the right girl.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
"Hmm" what?
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Well, not exactly.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
Why, yeah.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
How can that be?
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
With my money!
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
You wouldn't have done that?
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
Can't you tell me anything?
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
What the hell is that sound?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Take it off.
Why don t you just go for Price?
He's good-looking.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
Oh God, I can't believe this.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
Patrick?
That's Paul Owen.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Don't, I'll drink it.
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Dorsia.
What is it?
Patrick?
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
What's that?
Next Saturday?
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Understandable.  Lime?
You sure?
How well did you know him?
Do you feel that way?
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
So...you hang out here a lot?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
What!
What're you -- what?
They hack into people's programs?
He wasn't acting?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
Okay.
Is it your software?
What?!
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
We could move 'em up here.
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Gary, hi.
You look a little tired.
You could've handwritten it.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
What'd the girl say?
Ready for number three?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Did you wanna be alone?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
But why would they --?
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
They'd frame him.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
Time?
Why were you so careless?
That's lame, isn't it?
...You got my E-mail?
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Or sometimes not at all.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Thank you.
Be careful.
Carnies.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Yes, Basil?
Be careful.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
Watch out, you're on my hair!
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Who?
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Does that make you horny?
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Noooooooooooooo!
Is it one of ours?
We've got a lot of work to do.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Sea bass.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
In due time.
Umm, that also has already happened.
Flower ...
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
Have we met?
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Then who wins?
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
I resign.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
You.
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
You killed my husband.
Too many cooks --
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
But why? What's the point?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Why should they think that?
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Did he say who?
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
What on earth?
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
You followed me.
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
You first.
Trubshaw again? What now?
Where are you going?
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
Mrs. Peel?
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Makes two of us.
Getting to what?
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
We want Mrs. Peel.
Amnesia?
Insane ... ?
In your operation.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
The last one you'll ever see.
I was at Harrow ...
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
What do you mean?
Chulo, one thing at a time.
I want Debbie.
Seventy-five hundred.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
I've tried to change her mind.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
You better not have too much joy.
Can't I just go with you guys?
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Why is Cole here?
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I'll take some.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
You okay?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Oooooo.
Debbie.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
You're late again, Rick.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Did you do it for Tim?
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
Ya love it, probie?
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
I saw it.
You look great.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Homey.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
I was doing my job.
Leave Stephen out of this --
-- I work for the city.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
I'll see ya around, huh?
I don't have a story.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Your brother was a good man.
Brian?
Yeah. Big fan.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
What?
So, you surviving without me?
He just wants to --
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Investigator Rimgale.
Inspector.
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
He gots to be did.
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
YEAH!
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
So that's what you been doing?
Good morning, Cheeba.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
But the line has to be drawn.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Exactly!
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Manray!
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Thanks.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
You feel good, not nervous?
Same thing Giuliani said.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
Mommy, please don't call me that.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Where are you from?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Finland.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
I never had a really real pair before.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
How did you get this gig?
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Why don't you answer?
Where are you bound for?
Both of us ride home with Best here.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
Is Miss Dugan well?
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
That is a trifle strong.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
The milkmaid's daughter?
Dark Valdez.
Who?
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
I don't know... I like the Army.
You shot Childs and Nunez.
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Back up.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Jesus, what happened?
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
I didn't kill him --
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
I wanted to see if he was okay --
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
You're crazy --
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
You made me look like an idiot --
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
You're kidding.
I plan to grow on you.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
You wanted to get the truth.
Yeah.
For what?
Four --
What are you doing out here?
Nah.
He was your friend.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Oh, you remember now --
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Fifty minutes.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Thank God...
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
So?
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
I brought it.
Bloom!
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
Stop.
Can I take your picture?
I never knew.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
I can.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Did you do any of that?
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
She was a witch.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
When did you ever work in an office?
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
Son?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Tell me how it happens.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
Are you Jenny Hill?
Were you and my father having an affair?
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
How much time does he have left?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
That's not a burn.
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
Tell me what he said.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
What did he say? Tell me!
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Oh Jesus.
Is that everything?
Syevodnya?
Syevodnya
They go. John. They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
No I don't.
I know you just want to punish me --
Where's the restroom?
What?
What?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
It's none of your business.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
I don't hate you.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
No. I think I better just go.
Yeah. No thanks.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
I'm sorry.
No. What? No. I know.
Angela?
Yes?
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
You liked what I brung ya?
At church?
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
You ain't the kicker, are you?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
For your hands?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
YOU SHUT UP!
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
Why you got me chained?
How you let men treat ya like they do?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
You some kind'a pervert?
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
Let go of me...
Tell me what to do.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
What'chu sayin'?
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
That's right.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Are you wasted?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Ronnie. Please, baby...
I just wanted some make-up.
You got any money?
Thought you had a man for that.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
What are they doing now?
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Let's grab some food.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
How'd you get this?
Know her?
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
What's he saying?
Gaiijin.
I'm not drunk...
I want to yank Kobo.
Someone attacked him.
A wife.  She left.
Yes...
We can't lose.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
They want your autograph.
This is my stop.
Not in that company.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
If I say no?
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
What generation are you?
We have a lot in common.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
When?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
You got a machine on it yet?
Industrial refuse.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
How do I stop one?
Yes?
Prosit.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
I'm doing okay.
What's that?
Meaning?
Huh huh.
Yes?
What's suck night?
I bet I would.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
You use your equipment, don't you?
I can imagine.
How come you're not on the job?
How are you doing?
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
Like?
But then how can you...
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Is this to be an empathy test?
Discreetly.
Same thing.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
You look... better.
Twenty.
What's that?
Bravo!
You're kidding!
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Your mom was a dancer?
How do you do?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Are you French?
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
It didn't used to be that way.
Yes!
In the house?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
May I please be excused?
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Really?  Okay!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
What?
A card?
Yes.
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Tempus fugit!
Like a painting?
Uh-huh.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Yeah?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
Why did you park way back there?
What?
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Help you?
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Sure.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Well, where are you --
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Well, put it down and come in!
It shuts off automatically.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
You hear that?!
Yes, dear!
What's that noise?
To go up.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Let's eat our cake.
Yes...
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
We stay down here.
Yes.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
I knew you'd like him.
What's that supposed to mean?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Well, what do you think?
What's it to you?!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Uh, yes, you do.
Give it back to him.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
To get some frozen poultry.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
What do you want from me?
Sure I'm alright. 
I made it go down the toilet.
I, uh.
Nice guy. Who's he?
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Do you like my body?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Beeeee careful.
Do you love me?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
He's comin' back? What for?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Hello, daddy.
Those are my breasts.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
There ya go.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
No, you're right.
Good to see you, son.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Are you alright?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yes. I do.
Brilliant.
Why not?
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Okay, yeah, call.
Okay, thanks.
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
You want to tell me about it?
Actually. I've been in twice.
Yeah?
Okay, be careful.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Stop it Mike.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Anybody see ya?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Hey Murphy?
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
For what?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Can she I.D. them?
Pee...Per...Man.
The what man?
And the pennies?
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
Chief, what the fuck is this?
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
We'll keep going, Roc.
What is it my son?
I believe these young men are right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
The... The funny man.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
How was I ridiculing you?
Did you see that?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
You think we're going to be chased?
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
See if mine are in there.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
I'll just say it.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
See, now we've got a plan.
He's gone. He stole the car.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I have an idea for that.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
We've got sixteen dollars.
She needed it.
I want you to look at this.
What is it?
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
Good. It's supposed to be.
I don't know.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
What are you talking about?
Like amnesia.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
Pretty much everything.
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
What do you mean?
How big is it?
How does that feel?
No, that door over there.
Are you afraid?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
We're renegades from despair.
I hope not.
Where you going?
Bob, where you going?
Why not?
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Let's not even talk about it.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
The front stairs.
What's he doing here?
So who's going to know?
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
I can't believe you said that.
This is natural.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
You can go first, Bob.
My brother's in jail.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
What is it?
Not bad.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Do you have your own room?
I'm working on it.
I might have mentioned it.
He said you ran away from home.
The grammar?
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
The world needs dreamers, son.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
You told me Bourne was dead.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
...this is Conklin's computer.
Excuse me.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
It was staged?
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I can't let you do that either.
Pamela Landy?
You called it in?
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- it's just him? --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
What if it's not who you think it is?
See that tram coming around the corner?
A Russian?
What do you mean?
Your first assignment was Geneva.
What?
-- who? -- who else is here? --
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Did you?
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
And why is that?
So?
By who?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
But... what will you do?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
The Scots will fight for us?
So I did! And what was so important about it?
No, M'lord.
You mock us with a smile?
You fancy him.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
I rest.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
A common thief.
We must run in different directions!
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
I've missed you.
And I with you. But you must wake.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
Um... can dad come this time?
No.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
Please, mom. People will talk.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
You're. Acting. Like your father.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
What did you see? What did it look like?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Where are you now?
But I... I need those books.
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
I've stopped a hundred times.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Where... where are my clothes?
I walk differently?
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
He did. Captain Renault did.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
You want my advice?
Yes, Monsieur.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Er, goodbye, sir.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
What are they?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
A franc for your thoughts.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Strange. I know so very little about you.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Put them on the table.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
But why my name, Richard?
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
No.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Goodnight.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
He came from Paris with Rick.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Good evening, gentlemen.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Mademoiselle.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Uh huh.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
Rick! Rick, help me!
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Feels so good to lie here.
Can't.  Need water.
Take it.
Take it, damn it.
You're putting off the inevitable.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
It's real.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
You know what happened to this?
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
No.  that was the last one.
Cold.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Hey, look at you.
He is a cute thing.
You know, for when you travel.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
I know.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What's that, written on the sail?
What was inside?
So simple to say, so hard to do.
I love you, Chuck.
When's the next Jumbo?
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Don't you even think about it.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
Can you find her?
You are one sick fucker.
That's what it's about.
Thanks.  For everything.
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
Why not?
You cook very well!
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
How many months are you?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
I *know* this was right.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
Please don't...
Hi...
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
I can't go nowhere.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
What kind of plane are you flying?
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
I don't know it.
I haven't read that.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
Where's the name sheet?
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Do you know him?
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
They told me I was too old to serve.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
So how'd you get caught?
Like what?
Guess so.
Whoa. What?
You'll be there?
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
I guess it lacks a certain style.
How much?
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
What about... The money?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
That's not --
Says who?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
What the hell's his problem?
It's what I do. It's my job.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
Tick-tock...
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
Do you have a ticket?
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
I'm sorry.
King ain't gonna like this.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
What?
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Ten percent.
Special Agent?
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
Jack Manfred.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Not like Matt, you mean.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
How about five hundred.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
All right. As what?
I'll try and make it.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
I had training. In the Republic.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Marion. It's a book.
That girl, she works at the casino --
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
There's a casino in this hotel.
So why did you come to my casino?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
Toss you for it.
How did you hurt your hand?
Which side do you like?
I didn't.
I'm in trouble.
The point is, they want a man inside.
Next time it'll be my neck.
I want you to forget what I said.
Yes.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Over the river.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
Hey Jack, join us.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
Where's the magnet?
Five.
What makes you so sure?
Yes.
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
Thanks for the information.
Bruised.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
Oh. What's wrong now?
Where is it? What did you do with it?
The key, goddamit, the key!
It didn't go off.
We've got to disarm the bomb.
What was that, I didn't hear...
What the hell?
Fuck that shit.
Well, there's the possibility of...
Huh?
Hey, bomb.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
Hmmm...
...nine seconds...
Mafhkin oble groop...
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Any planets?
Commander Powell would have named it.
-- open circuit breakers --
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
You know what I think about, Talby?
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
We're running out of time, sir.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Sir?
Yeah.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
What're you talkin' about?
That's a lotta crap.
What the hell are you doing?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
What is it?
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
What else can we do?
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Too early to tell.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Bent.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
You believe that?
What's this?
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
But she does work here?
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You did.
How's this about me?
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
That's odd...
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
How long you and me known each other?
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Not right now.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
She's got my word.
But there's another side--
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
Right, slow...
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
One more time in English.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
What's gone?
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Go ahead, Jam.
Ahh, sunshine.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
What?!
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Not if I shoot first!
Good morning...
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Good MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
Hi... what's going on here?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
What did you say?
You'll know soon enough.
Why do they call you Frank?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Wonder where we'll be then.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
What? How long was I asleep?
Did you call the cops?
Come with me.
Is that a cellar door?
People aren't that simple.
You're my only son...
I know, Dad.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
What's "Cellar Door"?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
So, I met a new friend.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
Can anyone else see him?
A sign from whom?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Yes. I went to jail.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
You've done it again?
If God exists?
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
How is that possible?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Yeah.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Gerald.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Excuse me?
What else?
No more fuckin' for her.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
So, what do I say?
This came for you, sweetie.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Amber? Here.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Mrs. Leeman?
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Here, I didn't get any.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
I'm a mirror.
Wisconsin.
The bitch.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Enid ate a whole pan!
Harold!
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
"My dear"...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
Is that all?
Father...
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
I don't want him.
No, but I shot some ducks.
What other job you got?
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
She did.
I can't do it...
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Anything else? 
Fine.  We gotta him. 
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
Give me that again!
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
Your Excellency!
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Yes please, two.
I've always thought that myself.
What do you mean?
Well, these things take time.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
What are you going to do?
He fell.  He falls.
Never mind that, I want my man!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
You've acquired a taste for this?
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
...everyone has been very kind.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Want to come out?
My name is...
The Children. Where are your children
...my... home?
You did this for me?
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
It's all right! It isn't happening!
What's the matter?
Yes.
I'll bring it back.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
Is it night or day, Erik?
REALLY?
No.
Well, how d'you think I feel?
I'll tell you what...
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
What?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
Why should you care?
We're missing all the fun...
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
A magic dishcloth.
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
Vanish into thin air?
You're wasting your time.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
Are you all right?
I know. I know.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
Together we stand!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
Yes, Mother.
You weren't supposed to see that.
Thanks, guys.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
And I just liked you so much.
Come over after I'm done here?
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
In the room?
Oh, baby, what's going on?
I'm so excited. Yay!
Okay, I guess.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Thanks.
When?
Oh, thank God. It's going.
Oh?
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
Naomi, I guess.
I'm sure, I said.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I know.
What do we do?
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Me too. There's this poem --
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
I do sort of live with somebody though.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
Bye, Joel.
I think I should go back.
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
I know. I had to take the day to think.
It was snowing.
How's the chicken?
Okay. I wish you could come.
Hi.
How was it?
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
You made me have an abortion.
Stan? What's going on?
He went home sick.
This one's history. Moving on...
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
But I don't know how to polka.
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
A traveler, eh?
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Yep.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
What?
Coffee.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
What's happening...?
90 over 50 and falling... .
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
How do you know all this?
Justin.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
What's the hold up?
That's a negative, Starck.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
That is not acceptable --
Any survivors?
No one?
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Don't... don't do this...
What about my ship?
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
Jesus...
Do we have enough time for a weld?
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
How much oh-two do we have?
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
Who?
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Miller, come in...
What's going on in there, Starck?
Weir.
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
There's no one in the corridor but us.
You got any coffee?
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
How?
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I mean...
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
I'll be watching over you.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
Five times.
We're working as hard as we can --
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
What?
But all these people...
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
Yes, thanks.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Are you kidding?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Not until Ben is back inside!
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I understand the business reasons.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Something happened to them, mon.
Where did you hear that?
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
I don't know.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
No.
Really?
Mark. What happened to your date?
Damone! You come here?
No Damone. I don't understand.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Yes.
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
All right.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
So what did you do?
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
You better save some for me, you swine!
I don't know. I guess so.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Where do you feel like going?
This is a nice car.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
What's the message? My light is blinking.
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Naked!?
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
How long do I have?
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
NO! Stop talking like that.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Lucy is looking for you.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
You realize...
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
In that case, maybe she can help.
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
I will not die because of him!
Yeah.
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
We just smeared a skunk.
Scared?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
What's in the back?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Got 'cha!
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Let's wait it out.
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
What did we say about lying?
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Putting on my armor.
Oh. I mean, good.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
You're afraid!
An actress.
Get your clothes on.
Get your clothes on, lady --
You learn your lines?
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Dick, we need some time apart --
What night?
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
What do I do, Dad?
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Please, Francie...
You're poisoning that child's mind.
See you next weekend?
Okay then...
Yeah, well --
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Jesus.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Yeah.
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
No, Harry, I can't -- 
What?
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Frances, You're crazy.
I love you, Harry. I love you.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Why do you say that?
Pretty morning.
Shit!
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
You kill me, Mama.
I'll be back.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
I don't believe so.
I see.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
You drove him to his torment.
Nice.
Come warm yourself if you like.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Kill you? Hardly that.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
She's beautiful.
Nothing. Still nothing.
It's been months. It's not like him.
What does it say?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Only you.
You make me weak.
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
I was just clearing my throat.
I am not mad.
Are you having me on?
You're making a scene!
How much longer?
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
Quite a place.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
Why?
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
Who are you?
You draw very well.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Oh, my God...
Filmmaker.
It still hurts?
Help you clean up?
I'll go check on Brenda.
Marcie?
I'll be along.
Holy shit...
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Looks like a storm.
Are you wet?
Mmmmmmmph.
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
You like the car?
So do I just follow you?
Yeah, follow us.
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
What about Kate?
You don't believe in suicide.
Jacob.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Not a chance.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
You too, preacher?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
I promise.
What you said to me in the room.
Do you believe me?
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Daddy's dead.
-- you got your microwave --
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Yeah?
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
What?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
No, I didn't.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
What?
What do you mean?
How are you?
Yeah, it's mine.
You could take their head off.
That's what I hear.
Don't say my name.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
None at this time, sir.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
So I'll get a fair shot?
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
Smoke her.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
What changed?
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
You don't know that.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
Just a coincidence?
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Whose orders were those?
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
That's a good story.
Last time I didn't.
Just askin'
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
I think you're the liar.
Do you?
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
The first female President?
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Where's Audrey?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Animal, I can't.
Don't you think we have enough?
Think we can fit up in there?
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Nesting?
You'd be surprised.
Who is he?
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Can I use some?
This is not the place...
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
And you're beautiful...
Call me Charlie.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
What?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
That is our job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
You gave them the tape?
Are you looking for this?
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
What's with the chewing gum?
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
It's Raymond.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
This is it?
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
You go first! There's no time!
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
You could order something in.
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
I don't know.
Those blue things ate everybody here?
You said "the Commander.
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
Yes?
There is no weather in space.
U.... What do you think?
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
You Okay, Alex?
...The digital conveyor.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
They're still behind us...
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
~e're alive!
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Unbelievable.
Yes.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
WHAT? WH
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
And a French alliance?
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
The army needs you.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Misunderstood what!?
Yes, general?
Yes, my lord.
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
I'm so inclined.
Sir, I think no such thing.
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Gag on your own invention, then.
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
Unofficially, General Greene.
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
They help me understand why we fight.
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
I rode here, on my horse.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
We're leaving them?
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Well, this must be about something!
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Where... do those men come from, George?
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
That's good... who?
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
Juba was a Numidian.
You're kidding me, right?
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
So where's the money?
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
I have to ask you for that key.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
You gave him the money?
What's this movie you're doing first?
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
What about her?
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people -
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
The airport.
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Who?
You live in Miami?
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
You just did.
That's it? That's your movie?
The shylock's the good guy.
Part of it, yeah.
Really? You ever been arrested?
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
You don't even know these guys.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
We talk different?
So you want to know.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
They report it to the IRS.
That's right. Three percent.
...That's what we finally decided.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You're as bad as Harry...
You okay?
You bet.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
That's what it says.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
Maureen.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Ready?
This's gonna hurt a little.
What're you crazy?
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
What is it?
Turbine rotor's shot.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
I think you know.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
You're late.
Sorry.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
She was sailing up north, right?
Nope.
There's somebody else on this boat.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
What do you think happened on this boat?
What happened?
What?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
Of course they did.
It's funny.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
You don't remember?
He took the shotgun and a light.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
Not the Maxine?
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
What are you trying to say?
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
Did you actually do this painting?
Help me what?
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Aren't there a million places like this?
Do you want something to drink?
What do you mean "why"?
Nothing.
Then why do you hate me so much?
Why not?
God, what a bunch of retards...
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
What? Why?
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I remember every minute of that party.
What are you talking about -- who?
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
Do you think he knows?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
It's always closed...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
I know a party we could go to...
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
No way... when?
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
You're just jealous.
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Now are you going to get a regular job?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
You're insane.
What happened to Seymour?
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Hi.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
You're late, asshole.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Do you have any old Indian records?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
A dollar seventy-five.
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
Oh, right...
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
Good luck...
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
So is that your boyfriend?
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Shh!
Yes, that would certainly do...
For nineteen years...
Yeah, but still...
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Are you okay?
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
Oh yeah?
Wow!  What was that all about?
Oh, hi...
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
...What do you mean?
Can you at least let me in?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
What about Joe?
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
What do you want?
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
But, I...
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
I don't know.
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
Seymour?
You were contracted to work-
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
...one shot...
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
Got me out of trouble.
We need to talk.
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
I'll have to.
Why?
Nonsense.
He has children?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
And where will you sleep beautifully?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Do you ever see him?
Certainly.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
Oh, hello, Peter.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
This is the one that looked at Dana.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
I'm Ray --
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Ready?
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Eight o'clock?
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
That's a violin concerto.
I told you, I ...
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
All right.
Great rehearsal.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Print is dead.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
Can I help you?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
That's "Peck!"
Two wavy lines?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
What do you mean "bad?"
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
I agree.
Life is just a state of mind.
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
What?  What popped in there?
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Mmmhmmm.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
If I may be so bold...
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
Yes?  Go on!
Then you'd be out of a job.
Gladly Caesar.
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
You flatter me, Caesar.
Caesar?
Caesar, ignore them.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Would that Marcus had lived.
Servis made it through again?
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
I was summoned.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
This is our oil from our estates?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
Let him trust Quintus.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
No.
Will you take me home now?
What?
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
What's the matter?
-- really incredible --
All right then! Yes!
Did you say rape her?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
But Elaine --
Benjamin?
When?
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
Why wouldn't it?
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Oh no. He said that.
Shhhh.
657-2036
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Yes, sir.
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
Yes, I will.
What's that?
What are you then?
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
BENJAMIN?
Yes.
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
Did you get a room?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
What? No. Nothing.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Oh my God.
Pardon?
What's wrong?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
I know that. But I'm --
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
But they would! Don't you see?
Would you like me to seduce you?
What?
How are you?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want to?
Do you want me to get it?
I'll be up in five minutes.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
This is all terribly wrong.
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
That you're afraid --
Well what do you want to talk about?
Well?
Oh.
What one.
What do you say to him?
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
See if you can guess.
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Yes.
There's nothing to tell.
Well, I'm not.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Don't start acting hurt.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
How?
Then you'd better start believing me.
I drive around.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Why?
Oh no.
I've got to go.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Ben, can I say something to you?
Quite a while.
Oh yes.
No, it's not --
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Don't shout at me, Ben.
The Carlsons' are here.
Need any help?
No.
How?
I don't like your tone.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Oh!
Too bad.
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
I'd given you up.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
And then --?
Go away. Who are you --?
Yes -- I do understand.
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
What can you see?
You are beautiful!
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go -- good-bye.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
I take five hundred.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
Is that for me?
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Dance then? 
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Am I!
Tired?
What brown hands you have.
That's from skiing.
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
No.
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Tomorrow morning.
Can you pay some attention to me?
I mean with the Manchester people?
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
It is time for the performance.
What -- what is it? Last night...
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
I don't know you.
I could not think of not accepting.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
Yes, I know them --
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
What's the matter with you?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
My son --
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
Motherhood.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
You're a thousand percent right!
You know it, Lilly.
Roy? He's always crying.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Want a look?
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Here you are! Two rich people!
What? He's going to be all right!
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
What's up?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
Not as tough as you, huh?
I tripped over a chair.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
You must have some money.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
I know you do, so that's why --
You want a drink?
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
Scram. Go home.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
Get well soon.
Big spender.
Working the what?
The tap. What you do for a living.
I've heard the name.
Is that right?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
Open your door.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
What?
You watch that mouth.
I realize this is a shock.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
Yes, I know, I know.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
It's an option.
What?  Where is she?
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
I can see that.  Why?
Can I come in?
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
Oh, right.  Sorry.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Shane's going as a condom.
You're so easy...
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
Who are you?
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
What now?!
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
It was you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
You've created a monster.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
How all the magazines show tits today.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Can I have the Cadillac?
How short the skirts are.
And how were things?
Excuse me.
Huh.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
Maybe it's time you got out.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
Out!  Out!
Dr. Woodly.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Man and boy.
What's good about that?
"The sting."
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Damn.
Play?
The smallest thing I've got.
Dad--
Dad?
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
"Hamburger Heaven."
Sir?
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
You don't even know me.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Nothing would please me more.
You used to like it stark!
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Which one?
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
I don't think so.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
Pacqualinincheewa root.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
Good Lord.
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
I'm an honorable clown?
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
More clowning!  Don't you see?
Don't shoot.
Can't do it.
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
Ja?
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
Stay home tonight!
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
I was afraid to ask.
What's his name?
Don't know.
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
Don't worry about it.
It's fine!
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
Please--
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
I see.
Coming.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
What then?
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
You figure!
I'm sorry.
Marry me instead.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
That's the XKE.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
It's a jungle out there.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Do you want to take a session?
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
What?
What do you mean?
You want a tip?
Yeah, yeah...
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Tod might know.
Something like that. How much do you make?
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
But then you'll forget about me.
...What do you have to offer?
That's right.
Mast?
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
In G.R.? Why?
No.
Do you think she's safe?
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
What are you doing here?
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Is Marsha there?
What?
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Take it or leave it.
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Jake.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Hold it, mister.
You never heard of that?
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
Who's that?
You're taking a big chance.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
No.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
But there is a family resemblance.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Do you dance?
Your hearse?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
It's very interesting.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
No. 
You don't look eighty.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Why not?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
No.
He's stopped.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
The ice is melting.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
What was that?
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Yes.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Supper for two.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
And why is that?
Just give me a rough estimate.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
No.
No.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Oh sure.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Harold!
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Frank.
I knew you'd come.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
She certainly has.
And you're sure it was a woman?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
O.K. Let's go.
I'm scared.
They were over here, Professor.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Here. You'll need one of these.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Do you believe in hell?
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
Each of us gets a belt.
-- should go back. Now!
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
You want me to hold him down?
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Anything else you --
You're going alone?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
Red, I --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
A brute.
I know.
That you feel that way about me.
Hit me.
Pardon?
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
We're leaving.
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
The box... you opened it. We came.
This isn't happening.
Wedded bliss?
A box?
What kind of doors?
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
You would be. They tore me apart.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Why not?
So damn stupid.
Are you all right?
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Sure.
What are you drinking?
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
You know, you're very beautiful.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
YOU'D like my room.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
Of course. Every day.
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Really?
Yes!
You know I do know the way home.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
I beg your pardon?
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
I wanna date a musician...
What are you snickering about?
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
No way.
No.  We need the gig.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
Well what about the new Echo --
Oh.  Okay.
What do you mean, four more?
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
I'll tape it for you.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
I always hated this song.
Can I do anything?
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
And do you like it that way?
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Just ask it!
Is it better?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
We'll talk some other time.
I told you I slept with him.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Me?
Do you want me to be there?
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
When are you going back?
You know, with Ray...
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Look, we can do other things.
C'mon.  I want to know.
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Where?
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
Not in love, exactly, but...
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
About what?
What's happenin'.
What difference does it make?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
So you'll stay?
These are worth at least, I don't know --
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
Seventy-five.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
You're the expert.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
People like that rarely leave business cards.
Jesus Christ.
Not your concern.
You've been listening to rumors.
Yes.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Yes.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
That's insane.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
Thanks.
Four?
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
It's that important?
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Your name is Conor?
I was nearly killed.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
I'm twenty-two.
What?
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
Impotent cow.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
Tradition.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
Your name?
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
It can be different.  It must be.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
My father taught me.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
How many came?
How are you?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
I want you to come to me.
This your present address?
No.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Too hot?
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
Yes, wasn't it?
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!

Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
No. My mother.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
Out of the mouths of babes.
I notice you still remember it.
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
What do you mean by that?
You bet I've got a better offer.
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
He's in the insurance business.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
You're not afraid, are you?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
How much do you want on it?
Is this the Community Hospital?
Will you come here?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Where'd you wire him?
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
How about Bruce's?
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
They're always after me for interviews.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
I don't know --
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Where'd you get this?
Just one second --
What do you mean -- through?
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Okay.  Forget it. 
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
How'd you get here, Earl?
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Are you all right, now?
What do you want?
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
You're the biggest fibber.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
I don't know?
Weeds will grow, Mac.
What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
It looks....foreign.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
What are you going to be then?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
Out.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Up to six weeks, I think.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
What about the tree?
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
That's not something to joke about.
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
Why? You gonna do something about it?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
No, really.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Yeah, no shit.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Keep straight on this road here.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
So.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
God damn.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Just back up.
I'll go. It's my fault.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Thank you.
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Turn up this road.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
Over.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
Oui. Perfect!
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
I am sleepy.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Hmmmph.
Gabby, what is it?
What?
Well?
No. You look so beautiful.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
You what?
He's dead.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
You still in the market for a real boy?
My brother is discreet.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
How'd you know where I was?
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
Where?
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
How's it going?
Paper or cloth?
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
I'm not sure.
You do?
You really enjoy my company?
I like you, too, Nathan.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Flares?
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
What are you doing in there?
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Shit.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
Comin' in or goin' out?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
Do we need words?
You know what's good for him?
For whom and for what?
Cash.
Okay?
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Seventy-five per cent.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Hey, Findley's here.
Well, we won't.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
It's a long walk.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Aaaahhhh!
Maybe. You want to play?
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Whaddya mean?
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
How do you feel?
In the gut, I mean.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
You quittin' too?
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
What time does the bus leave?
Have a nice trip.
Can I sit down?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
I'm not.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Okay. So what's your name today?
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
Oh, cut my finger.
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
Give it back to me.
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
Would he know?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
He's a gambler.
Well, he owns things.
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Leave now.
Why should I?
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
Yes.
Humans.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
If we want it, it is.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
... and Rigel.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
What's wrong, Ellen?
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
What is it?
Your father asked you a question.
I have school.
What do you want?
What do you want me to do?
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
What's the bad news?
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
What happened?
Then what?
What the hell is that?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
But what, General?
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
It had been deemed classified.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
I'm a dancer.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
I shouldn't have left her.
We're already over Mach 2!
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
But I gave you some this morning.
You sure?
I'm not leaving.
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Marcus!  I did it!
All your life.
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
Doctor Jones?
Yes?
Are you sure?
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
I said go around!
You said go between them!
The Grail Diary.
At least I let you tag along.
How did you get here?
Dad!
No, Dad. You listen to me --
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
I'll never forgive myself --
My lucky charm.
What???
This is intolerable!
Dad!
My Diary's in Berlin.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
This is intolerable!
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
Uh-huh.
After you, Junior.
Who are you?
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
Just a routine inspection tour.
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
You understand what he tells us?
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
Let up on the brake!
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
I like the service here.
India...
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
What?!
PET IT??!!
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
He's afraid of something.
Primitive sexual practices?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
It's okay. You're all right now.
You've got to go to sleep now.
No... they won't kill me.
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
It wasn't him.
Yes?
Where are we?
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Yeah...Who?
You've heard of the PEM114...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I know...it sounds insane.
Kill myself.
Yep.
Of course you do!
Oh...Gooood!
I'll tell you what to say.
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
It can't take that long.
They could put you back in the tube..
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
I am. You are.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Thanks.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Find You?
Corridor A.
Take a left and your next right.
Who is it?
What do we do?
I can't do that.
...and a license to kill...
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
Holy shit!
Al, are you doing anything in there?
Don't just stand there, say something.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Which one?
Maybe she's telling the truth.
What is it?
It's embarrassing.
What if she says something important?
Bingo.
Osaka?
I can't...
What are you doing?
You sure this will work?
Holy...
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
Doesn't matter.
Can you fly this?
It's a long story.
They have stolen state property.
They took the tapes.
Al Viola.
What things?
Well...
Oh....Sure.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Yes...What is it?
...Blake
You again.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Your friends, did they ask about me?
Why did they leave?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
Who did?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
We're very close.
One chip?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
What is it?
Where we going?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
I asked him.
Why not?
Are you alright?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
That I really don't know.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Why did you, then?
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
It was you.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
Three hours.
P.J.'s.
What? Forget it.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
What does that do?
You're exaggerating!
You're taking "no" for an answer?
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
How are you, Jim?
I didn't want to leave it there...
Where should I wash them?
What's the difference...
"60 Minutes"?
What's wrong?
Get some perspective, Lowell.
That's right...
Yeah.
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Lowell.
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
I disappeared on you?
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Mike... in my...
How have you liked your stay?
Should I just take the documents now?
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
Like what?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
The new place? New.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
Good. But Jeff...
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
You manipulated me into this...!
Did he hear you?
Just give me an example...
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Hello.
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
That's why we hire scientists...
Well, I wouldn't say --
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
You did good, Massey!
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
What?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Marylin! What have I done?
These are yours.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
He'll regret this.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
She didn't love you?
And here I thought my mother was...
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
No.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
May I come in?
I want to nail you ass.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Hello Marylin.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Income tax evasion?
Rex. Get away from the door.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Marylin?
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Forgery and Fraud?
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Lilly's up.
Every week --
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Excuse me?
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Ha Ha.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Did Marylin end up with money?
Rex, please.
Video.
Sorry.
No. You're not.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
Extinguish?
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
Yes, sir?
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
South America.
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
On the road.
He's marvelous!
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Why should she? After all
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
What happened?
Any others?
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkand if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .
Whadda you want!
Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
What are you talking about?
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
Are you talking to me!
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
I can't go out like this.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Detectives!
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
You weren't so bad yourself.
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
You always want to run everything.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Yeah.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
That's silly.
What are you thinking about?
Hitch-hiking.
Carrots.
Oh, no!
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through.
You might give me a little credit.
What for?
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Congratulations.
sixseveneightnine
Not interested. 
Where's the bus to New York?
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Isn't he here?
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Joe, listen
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
If it's on the level.
Well, I got it, Joe.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
See that. They're gone!
Not a minute!
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with
Yeah. Just babies.
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
No, I'm not...
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
What's it look like, Nick?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
I did.
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
I had the cause of death.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
Daddy!  Where have you been?
...you heard echoes.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
Aren't you being a little hard?
A Perry Russo?
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
Nonsense.  What next?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
My sympathies.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
Post Office.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
You know who the mayor was?
Who?
The Warren Commission call him?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
His name?
It never did. 
The assassination, Jack?
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
That sounds fun.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
Won't forget?
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
What'd ya mean?
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
She wants to go back to work.
What's in it?
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
What's her name?
It's kind of a sports bar
You know who put the dope in your bag?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
He's the one who wants you.
It was the other guy who busted me.
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
What'dya think?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
What?... What'd you do?
Really?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
He was here?
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
I'm not sure you answered my question.
Do you think they bought it?
It'll be more than that.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
What the fuck is that shit?
We can look into that.
You talk to him?
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
What did you do after that?
Killian's.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Beaumont Livingston.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
They already know it's you.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
Who?
No, I give it to someone else first.
What'd you care?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
Two months shy of four years.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Please.
Lemme have the bag.
Thanks, Baby.
What's your cost?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
An employee I had to let go.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Did you get it?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
You shot Melanie?
So you're sure she's dead.
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
He's a big one. You two tight?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
Hear what?
Did the police contact you?
Was she?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
You expect me to just walk in there?
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
Turn left.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Give me his home number.
I'm alive.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
What do you want from me?
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
It's cold.
I am.
Why do you say that?
Dr. Carlson's dead?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Who?
You should go back to her.
I can't relax.
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
Hell, you think I am?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
Jake, is that you?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Did you look around the headboard?
Your kid dropped it off.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
And look what I got.
What's in here?
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
She looked good then.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Oh, come on. It's early.
Can't you stop it?
What the hell are you doin'?
Remember that.
He said you didn't have one.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Bullshit!
I promise.
Sit down, Jake.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
I don't know you.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where have they gone?
Oh God!
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
I'll page him.
The army?
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
Do you want me to get someone?
Bring it in.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Duck fuckers?
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Sergeant!
Where have you been?!!
Where the hell were you?!!
Creepy.
You see that?
Everyone okay?
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Got it.  You ever space walked?
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Close the fucking door!
Later.
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
Robot huh?
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
I'm surrounded by idiots.
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
I didn't say I was good at it.
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
I'm sending you the files.
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
You wanna die?
What have you done?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
My cars. And a comic book.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
What do you mean 'We...?'
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
Shut up! Just pump her out!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Where is he?
Colorful, isn't he?
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
Who's that young man?
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
What d'ya mean?
What's that?
You all right?
Think the tide's with us?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
Follow him!
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
I'm supposed to be running.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Jesus, Bleek.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
We could get back together too.
I totally heard you did.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Huh?
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No, more commercial stuff.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
What is it?
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
Uh, thanks.
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Then what's going on?
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Hi Dad.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
I am a suicide risk.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Aha! You love him.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
You don't say.
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
You lose!
What?
You dropped this.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
You took this picture?
Adele... are you serious?
What'll we do out there?
What the hell is this stuff?
...thank you.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Can't hurt.
This the book your writing?
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Yeah?
So tell me... what happened here?
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
So how's it going?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Not yet.
Nervous?
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
78th.
Yep.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
Darcy?
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
You goin'?
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
Sup then? Sup?
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
At the block party?
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Yeah.
Come dance.
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
Miss, would I be prying?
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Passion...
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Whah?
Making love is like.
It's like...
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Yep.
What?!
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
It's me. Telly.
You want a wip-it?
To come?
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
What kind of problem?
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
I wouldn't know.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Local?
You think he's dirty?
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
You alright?
Did anyone stand out?
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Hello, Peter.
Did you know her?
Not really.
But you said you didn't know her.
Yes?
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
Kathy?
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
The most logical choice.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
Ten days ago.
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
A building?
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
Peter...
Just thought you might want to talk.
About what?
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Are you one of the players?
Yes.
It seems like such a complicated game.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
Another kind of game?
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Why?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
You're going to be late for your match.
You beat him.
I got lucky.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
I don't have to go through with it either.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
Where is the Fortress?
I don't know how.
Yes.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
You have not slept in two days.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
But you suspect.
Yes.
Can she be forced?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
From here, I must go alone.
Am I not worth returning to?
What business?
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
And where do you lead, boy?
Go, join them.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
I'm hungry.
I only want one.
I don't think it's working.
Food for crows.
He is the King.
They'll trample him to death!
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
A match for your son, I think.
She has the power to kill.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
But you would not stay with me.
We had no children.
Where is he? My son.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
...Office 2702.
No?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
OK, I'm fine.
Huh... 500 meters?
Wow! It's brilliant!
What?
May I ask you a personal question?
...Yes.
Yeah, what?
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...Composer.
You can't sit here like that.
Yes... Twice.
Where?
I have new dreams now.
I don't accept that.
I'll make it.
What?
How long does this... Mania last?
Okay.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
Why there?
What did they ask?
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
Doubts?  About what?
Red flag, man.
Jumped where?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
This story is big huh?
Mammoth.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Are you firing me?
What Mr. Parker?
I missed you Kris.
Are they standing?
I need your help.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
What do you mean?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
Coffee?
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
Please!
Thank you, Sera.
Will you lighten up, please?
I wanted to see you...
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
Yuri... are you...
I loved him!
No!
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
You can't even imagine.
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
The idiot speaks.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Too demure?
What?!
How could this happen?
Almost.
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Of course.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
No, silly. I go here.
Harvard. Law school.
Thank you. Having fun?
Now I am.
I didn't mean --
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Like some vile toadstool.
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Kill me... I want... so nice...
I see...
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
I don't expect you'd understand.
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
And, now?
Or looked so beautiful...
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
Gump, is it?
Enough!
It's bluebells!
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
And if she thinks me a liar?
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Something the matter?
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
We seek to undo the curse.
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
I may have said perhaps...
What shall we do?
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Where are you going?
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
I have no wife.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
Sunlight?
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
I can't see a thing.
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
She's dead!
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
And sweet?
Please...
Up ahead!
Simple as that, eh?
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
When does George get to come see his house?
What's that for?
I couldn't get it to go down.
And why was the alarm on?
Are you his friend?
No.
I had them in my pocket.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
What did you think it would be?
Hey.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Really?
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
We're not gonna do anything.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
Not really.
This is such a street of whiners.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
It could have been a squirt gun.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
A sink?
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
It's thirty feet.
I'm good, thanks.
Oh.
How old are you?
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
I hate this job.
Well, it's the least I can do.
I didn't recognize you!
I'm sorry.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Thank you.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Why would you be there?
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
Are you totally insane?!
Why?
It bugs me.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
Where are you going?
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
Hi, Alyssa.
How do you become something you're not?
I wish you had told me then.
Why wouldn't she leave?
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
Ah!  Oh....
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
A blueprint spool.
Where will you live?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
When's school over?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
I want him with me.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
Do you remember?
I dreamed about your house last night.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
That was the truth.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Peter left me yesterday.
I could die.
Are you going to kiss me?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
No.
No.
Nigger.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
Then what's the problem?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Married?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Maybe we oughta find another place.
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
So you made a generous contribution.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
Winston. His name's Winston.
What does that mean?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What do you want, Claude?
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
I don't know. Who do you want?
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Let it go, Claude.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
That was five years ago.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
What the hell are you doing?
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
What'd you say?
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Move it out.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
I prefer bourbon.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Apparently, your sister died.
What are you in for, Willie?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
I'm interested. Keep talking.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
We could create our own hell there.
And give you a good buzz.
I'll call her later.
She goes to Parson's, right?
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
How did you see me?
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Check one-two. Check one-two.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
You came through, Nicky.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
You keep a bat under your seat?
You gotta kill yourself.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
You think I'm a tourist?
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
It's freezing my hands.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
Sometimes, sure.
Valerie?
What do you mean, "possessed?"
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Off limits.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
How did they get in here?
I am.
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
Just wondered... what happens?
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
It has nothing to do with you.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
No.  Just no.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
I thought I had to do something.
I changed my mind.
I'm not armed.  Well?
Why is it wrong to run?
Maybe... sure...
I'm going to run.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
And then you killed him, right?
I let him go... believe me.
Are you here to help me?
If you trusted me, you'd know.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
But what is this -- why?
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
What does it mean?
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
And Sanctuary?
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
I have always been here...
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
Are you ready to put him in?
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Very strange.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
You know what I think?
I was here yesterday.
Pete?
I don't know.
We should stop seeing each other.
In pornos?
So, should I call Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
Okay...
Alice...
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Yeah.
What night is that?
The police called us.
Have you made any charges against him?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
What's your axe?
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
What do you mean? You're where right now?
That's why I married you.
Who's it from?
Good book, huh?
What night?
When you didn't come to the club.
I called, you know.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
So?
What the hell is going on?!
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
Mr. Eddy?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Yeah?...
I don't remember... What happened that night?
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
I don't know.
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Will you stop squawking!
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
I'm thinking.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Certainly not.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
They were in a quandary, and
Come on, Lovey.
Well, that's that, I guess.
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
No.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
That's intelligent.
You have no disputes over women?
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
buy and sell?
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
The only one.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Suppose she should leave it?
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
Are you the High Lama?
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Just what I needed too.
Yes.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
What is it? Has he fainted?
See that spot?
I don't know.
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
Did I say "if"?
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
Good.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I wonder.
You see, it's not a dream.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Hesitated, sir.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
And if I say yes?
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Well this didn't.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Sir--
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
It's a bug.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Kay--
Kay.  All I'm saying--
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
You figured what?
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Nowhere.
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Kay?  What's your 20?
Did it leave?
Take it.
Where are we going?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
They were performance pieces.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Lara called me.
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
The mall?
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
Are you reading my mind right now?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
It's a little late for that.
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
What's so funny?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
What safe place is that?
-- and then walk out.
Which one is that?
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Who?
Sean --
How did you get this?
You have an emergency call on your private line.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
I wanna kill my boss.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
We can stop him.
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
He looks familiar.
That was our apartment.
I haven't seen him in two years.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Not on me, sir.
Women?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
Should I fuck him?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
What time is it there?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
Yeah? You sure?
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
But what about them?
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Get your hands off of her.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
What's up? Jess ready?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
So, when's the drop.
No.
Heard of them.
Quick drop. In and out.
This one?
She was fast, huh?
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
What?
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Any time, bro.
He implied it.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
C'mon, man...
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
They asked who it was.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
I mean, that's what I heard --
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
So is this the drop?
Like I said, I don't know.
Yeah.
Where do you think you're going?
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
Eighty.
You did?
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
No. I'll wait here.
I want to leave right now.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
What's up, man.
Yes?
Ow, shit...
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Is it nice?
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
I get it.
We're square.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
What they call you?
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Did you just now con me?
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
I'll give you back the 600.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Man live by his rep.
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Do you?
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
Just an idle question.
Are you?
I'm in Detroit.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I just want to sit here and be still.
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Dear heart, where are you?
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
Yes, sir, I did.
I know where you're going.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
No. You'll be marked for death.
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Are you sure?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
I don't know shit about you.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
Where do I find you?
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
[No!]
[Don't lie to me.]
[I believe you.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
Were you provided with a gun?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
So how's business?
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
I'm a bargain.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
What are you doing?
Do you think he'll come back?
Why do you ask?
So how come you know so much about those countries?
Yes.
The world of our children. How dare they?
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Planned what?
Rosanna Guerrero.
Last night. Do you know something?
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
[You have the money.]
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[Who's that?]
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
What?
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
I'll call her up.
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
Where?
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
We just talked.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
This is the kitchen.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
I'd like that very much.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Where you going now?
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
Hey, Ang'...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
What nurses?
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
He coming home right now.
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
You talked to Walt?
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Stop him! Stop that man!
That's right.
Epidural hematoma?
You really think we hurt him that bad?
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
He can't take much more time on the table.
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
When?
I think it's a marvelous letter.
We think the same way.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
A football game?
Right.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
Black capsule.
We stand behind all our work.
No, no, that one.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
Ayuh.
Even if I weren't.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Why would he do that?
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
In the direction you want to go.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
Sir?
Morning, Radar. How were things?
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
Nice.
Are you all right?
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going
Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
A hundred dollars!
That's good.
Oh.
The Websters!
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
What?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Wait a minute . . .
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
Say that again.
What John Doe?
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
What John Doe?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
Plus a bonus.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
I ain't seen him for a week.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
What?
Who's got him?
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
The heelots!
Ba-ll!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
No!
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
That's got nothing to do with it!
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Uh-huh.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
How?
Shh!
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
What's the line?
Where did you find an old recording like that?
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Tell my dad.
Manual or automatic?
Who are you again?
Hi, Roper.
Being faxed over now.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
You don't have to come here.
I've rarely shot anyone.
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
You'd never been out of New York?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
You have to. It's a tradition.
You living together?
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
You tell me.
Why?
I'm just practicing my lying.
The 6 horse is still last.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
I ain't interested in your life story.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
What do you want from me?
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
When?
Scottie, Scottie...
Yeah.
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Where's the damn wire?!
Depends. What's up?
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
What do you think would be in order?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
The car is part of the deal.
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
How come I can't remember?
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
Your life that bad?
Do you believe in miracles?
It's all here...
What's happening?
No.
The maze has been changed --
New York.
What's her name?
Take care.
Try harder.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
One condition.
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
Why?
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
Realize?
Not you.  A copy.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
What's so funny?
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Resurrection.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
PTERODACTYL!
You okay?
All systems go!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
And how do we do that?
It's... an eagle?
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
You own a hotel, sir?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
I guess I am. Just a little.
What do you mean?
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
I needed to see you again.
Why? You're the innocent one.
Charlie?
I'm doin' business here!
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
It's not myself I'm worried about.
You're getting' 10 cc's
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
They're friends of our enemy.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
You disrespect our tradition.
Masseria's been after me too.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Forget it.
Guess I'm just lucky.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
Monkeybone?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Stu Miley.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
How was it? I don't recall.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Kimmy! What's the matter?
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
You mean it's dangerous?
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Thanks very much, sonny--
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
It couldn't be.
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
What! Who?
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
Yeah.
Good idea. When?
Tonight?
Have *you*?
We're gonna get married.
You said it!
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Otis!
How do you feel, champ?
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Thank you, sir.
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Y-yes.
Will he yield for a question?
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Yes, Ma?
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
Hello, Jefferson.
Office of--Senator Smith?
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Convene?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
Second drawer.
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Thanks a lot.
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
Don't mention it--
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
But--I've done everything I--
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Hurray!
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
Well! You don't say!
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
How's that, buddy?
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Susan!
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
Why don't you do it yourself?
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Jim, I won't stand for it.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Jim!
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
Yes.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
They think he's pixilated.
Pixilated.
I haven't.
That's all, Miss Bennett.
What's that got to do with it?
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
Yeah, I know.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
A girl?
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
People have been crucified before.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Come on, come on!
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
How's it going? Okay?
Gold, eh?
Oh, yes sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Me sir?
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Newspaperman?
That's pretty.
You can't?
All set.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Oh, they insisted on following me.
I'm Chairman?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Me?!
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Let him alone.
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
Huh?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
That ought to be fun.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
Yes, ma'am.
Is she home?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
How did they threaten you?
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
Mr. Cook.
Why's that?
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
I don't want to hear any more today.
Mr. Follett.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
I was... never satisfied.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
What brought this on?
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
What do you think's wrong with her?
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
Oh?
Okay.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
Oh... not a real doctor.
Why don't you tell me?
Well... you see, the problem is --
What can you tell me about this?
What?
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
That's what I like.
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
Which show was that?
Sofie...
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
What do you want me to see?
What are you talking about?
What did he want you to do?
Nah... scotch.
I've got three big ones.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
What about it?
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Sorry...
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
Now go find me a big stick.
Goin' somewhere?
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
You will not believe it.
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
And what is he in prison for?
And what did he say?
Yeah, I was there.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
What did you find? What did you see?
Can you swim?
That "thing" gets me excited.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
You two!
You don't believe in curses, huh?
I'm staying.
Got it!
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
Hey,... don't I know you?
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
I knew you'd know.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Much less go outside.
We could really use some coffee --
No one will believe us.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Thanks.
Snap out of it!
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Just a waitress.
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Stay away!
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
What?
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
I'll drive.
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
Nah.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
Firepower costs money.
Not yet.
Here you go. 
Mother... it's not what you think!
Be a Mohican.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
Yes -- who spoke up?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
No, they're living in Nice now.
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
When you eat him, may I have some?
The first reports came in at about ten.
How did it spread so quickly?
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
No, sir.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
I very much doubt that he will.
Good evening, sir.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
But you will not... be safe...
I believe you sent for me.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
What was there to tell?
God help me -- yes.
Can you give me a drink, please?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
What did you say his name was?
Is he alone?
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
Great moves, Day-Day.
Me neither.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
I ain't trying to rob you...
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
You straight?
Just a little.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
You walked?
What's the matter?
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
You make it sound so easy.
You go first.
Wait.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Next time, page me first.
I don't play for no team.
It's alright.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
What kind of activity?
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Huh?
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
That's my girl.
What?
Somebody close?
What?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
Come with us, sir.
What's your point?
Where did you get these? Who are you?
What...?
He's dead?
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
No way.
Can we go now?
Keep it.
You remember me?
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
Yeah.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
Foreigners! Fuck!
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
She went.
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Walt!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
John...
Where's Mom?
Why?
I'm hungry, John.
Up river.
I mind you said there was two.
I'll see to Pearl.
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
Nothin'!
What's taking you so long about it?
Nothin'. 
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
I'm hungry.
About our secrets.
Why, pray tell?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
What's wrong, John?
What are you after them for?
You'll whip me!
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
What'd you all talk about?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
It's just a stupid cat.
Yeah. So?
How you plan to do that?
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
She lived there.
Krueger.
Where you think you're going?
What?
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Guess I should'n'a done it.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
Nice to have a fire.
Jungle man fix Jane.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
And there?
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
Misha! Misha!
That must be the one!
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
How are things in Moscow?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
We can call our ambassador.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
What did she say about me?
Comrade Kopalski...
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
We did our best, Comrade.
Yes, Comrade.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Business.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Oh no. No visa.
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
And what is your profession?
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Will you smile?
At what?
Then you should go back to your table.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
Not funny, huh?
Yes.
You see I couldn't shout that.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Darling, darling... please!
No speech?
Yes... a little white house.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Is this the wish of the masses?
Those newspaper people?
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
What does he say?
Huh?
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
You haven't seen her yet?
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
What is this, Swana?
She's gone, Leon.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
What do you want?
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
May I ask why?
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Where is it?
Your Highness.
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
I am sorry... I have to leave.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
I like it.  I like the idea.
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
We can't touch Hoover --
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
That fruitcake!  What about him?
What's Liddy got?
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
Where are they?
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
We could leverage Helms.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
What'd you say?
Mom expects great things from you ...
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
I never met the man.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
Kissinger?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
What do you mean, Jack?
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
But it was all we had.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
You're shittin' me.
Syracuse.
I like jazz ...
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
That's right.
Of them.
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
Are you serious?
You don't have to go.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
This.  Above all.
Are you okay?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
When?
You.  What' you're doing --
Don't be ridiculous!
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
In Angola. Yeah.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Yes ma'am, I do.
The old boy shot by the highway?
...You ride Winston.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
No sir.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
No.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Did you buy that gun?
Llewelyn!
What'd you give for that thing?
Promise?
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
Yessir?
Where does he work?
Hello?
...You getting anything on this?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
Well -- where ya goin'?
I don't need to talk to you.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Yes.
Everything.
Somethin' like that.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
It's all right.
What do you want to know?
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
What did I say?
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
I don't know. American citizens.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Are you jackin' with me?
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
Oh. How come?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Do what?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Of course.
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Really?
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
What's his real name?
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Worse.
He has no heartbeat!
You don't sound like you're from here.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Your husband?!
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Of what?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
I... I don't know...
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
That is so right.
Hell of a way to die.
What 'look'?
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
Like... us?
What?
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
You need to remember who you're talking to...
Who's this?
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
Isn't that the point?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
...Pete?
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Not out the other side his face, though.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
You said -
Uh-huh.
Who was fixing to betray us!
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
I am. Hur you?
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Okay, okay. You win.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
I want to fly, sir!
Yes, sir!
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
See you in the fleet, sir!
Before that.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
No, sir.
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
Vietnam?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
What?
He ask you out for next weekend?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Do you go to school?
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I bet you do!
How do you figure that's your bunk?
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
Do you know that for sure?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
I have the gun.
Yes.
She's gonna handle it.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Different tables.
Pure idiot.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Open it.
I mean it!
A what?
No fucking way.
How many more do we have after this?
What?
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
Damn it!
Feel okay?
Fuck.
I don't know, why?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Blue is phones?
Call Dad!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
What if I spazz out?
Those ain't cops.
Alma I told you to...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Lemme see that rifle son...
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Man, fuck you!!!
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Can you make a deal with them?
Yes sir I was.
We're working on that...
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
That's right brother... listen and learn.
So talk...
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
Wait a second there brother...
You were. infantry right?
So what's the deal?
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
I don't know about that.
Yeah.
Just a kid.
Nothing.
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
We'll all get out of here together.
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
No.
When?
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
Well?
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
I know that.
You're surrendering.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Their names, ranks and posts?
Are you going to meet with him?
Perhaps.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
Granted.  Where are you going?
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
You don't hate him.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
A long time ago...
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
Balderdash!
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Don't touch him.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Thank you.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Remember Braddock?
Father?
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Yes, but the rope might be--
No-I guess not.
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Going to tell Ellie?
Does she love the cat?
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
Almost there, Louis.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
I guess so...but...
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Let her go. It's cool.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
That's enough of that kind of talk!
I just said--
You better get going, hon.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
You stole my boat.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
That boat is my livelihood!
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Wait as long as you like.
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
Why would my father send this to me?
Me!
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
What?  He never told me that.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Move!
Agreed.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Jack!
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
Commodore --
A moment.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
Like rotting meat.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Consideration?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Did you feel that?
That might work.
Where did he go?
You don't want this.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
Same old Daniel.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Is something wrong?
Susan!
Look at this!
Who is he?
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
Argon's private lab.
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
Oh yes you are!
You were looking for us?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Exactly.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Your place?
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I see.
What's the idea, Anne?
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
What is this person doing here?
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
It has been alleged - yes
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
A what?
No?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
It's the smoke.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
Okay.
What do you know about Conrad?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
It'll be ready in a minute.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
Traps shut!
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Have you seen this? 
Yes - the worm!
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
But I
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yes.
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Oh no ... I'm fine.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
Oh, hello Betty.
Where'd you get this?
What?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Oh, gosh no.
... Lover's Lane.
Oh.  I can't.
What's the matter?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
The basketball team?
Why am I out of order?
Oh sure it is.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
Yeah. Every episode ever.
God, David. Just give it to me!
Can we do any better?
They don't notice that kind of thing.
Jen please ...
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Nothing.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Yeah.
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
You want some berries?
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Where are you going ...
Hello there.
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
What?
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
Just gimme the damn remote!
I'm so glad you're here.
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
No, no, no.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
What's the listing?
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
Yeah I can't.
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
Hey. What are you doing?
I....please don't do this.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
No.
Really?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
No.
You have a girlfriend?
No.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
I don't know.
Not very well.
Thank you.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Yeah.
How long have you known her?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
Yeah.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Ok.
Have a good trip.
Yeah?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
That's right you travel so much.
Yes I'm sorry.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Why?
I didn't do it.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
What's that for?
337.....I'm sorry....
What?
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
Can we agree that that is that?
Well I'm sorry. Before...
It's alright.
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
What?
Yes.
What is this, man?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
You can't be late.
That's it.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
What's the problem?
What did you say?
Put him through.
It's ok. That's alright.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
At your service, Count.
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
Ow!
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
You mean to take us all down with you?
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
Coulmier, you animal!
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
Of course.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
It was fiction, of course.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
I pray you: be succinct.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Good God, Marquise --
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
How was I to know, my darling?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Doesn't that please you?
So you ever gonna do a picture?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
My name is Orson Welles
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
There's no call for that language-
It's not really--
Marion--
There's nothing to explain
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
Thank you for your time
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
I wanna see the picture today
Hearst?
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
Nope.
Who the hell's Manolete?
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
This better be good
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Fuck you
It doesn't have to be
So, who is he? We have to know him.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
The title?
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Is that from one of the Gospels?
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Oh God.
You're going to destroy it
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
You talked to New York?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
I really think you're
No, we're jake. But listen-
About what?
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Believe what you want.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
You know, like bang her or anything?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
When?
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
What?
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
What?
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Does that mean...
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
No.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
You're not interested in him?
Huh?
That he's got a pretty face.
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
I am answering...
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
All right, I'll try. See you later.
This is the baby sitter.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
Feel a little foolish?
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
Jewelry?
That depends on who "they" were.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Your Lisa?
For getting rid of that cast.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Who are you?
I predicted it.
You're never going to marry?
We've progressed emotionally in --
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
You called the police?
What?
Got a shovel?
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
That's good news.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Yes.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
I have one now.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
What's the apartment house number?
What about it?
It doesn't make sense to me.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
That's a suitcase?
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
The same.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Friend of yours?
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
And you dropped it?
That's funny!
I don't think so--
Will you wait a minute?
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
I was talking to Jim.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
He's home.  I heard the car.
John Crawford?
You remember me?
Boy!
What?
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
What?
They're looking for you!--
Yeah?
We'll take it!
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
I've got a gun.
Here.
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
My gun?
Just a guard.
Plato!
What?
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
What a zoo!
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Yeah--why--
The kids take me.
Goodbye!  See you!
No--I was just--maybe--
You still pretty upset?
How many rooms do you think there are?
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
I never felt so clean before.
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Yes.  My best friend.
What's he like?
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
You weren't looking for company, were you?
No.
You said you'd call my father.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
We were romantic then too--
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Good evening.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Gabriel!
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
No --
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
I'll see what I can do.
Your pen palls dead, lady.
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
They've never done a robbery?
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
I don't know...
You shouldn't have.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Who are you now.
So you could get down her chimney.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
This isn't the Tomahawk.
So what the hell good are you...
Do I get a country-western name?
Don't tip.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
...never... tried...
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
No, you're not.
Get in the CAR!
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
Having romance problems, Romeo?
How do we take them out?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Three days, man.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Tell her... I'll be there ...
YOU TELL HER!
NO!!!
Switch seats with me.
Start talkin
How ya doin', Toothpick?
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Who?
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Who, Mr. White?
Did the two of you talk?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
What?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
Mr. Brown?
I'm sorry.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
You do?
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
Gun shot.
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
No real people?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
What do you think?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
How can you be so sure?
I got 'em, all right?
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
And one of 'em is sick.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Yeah.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
The who?
Will she be dark or fair?
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
It's going to Sonora.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Why?
So did I. They were in it.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Finished, son?
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
Go on, hit me.
What did you come back for?
You're not bein' quite fair.
I said I didn't care.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
That something I shouldn't see?
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Yes, people make me restless.
Even women?
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
I tried my best, but these things take time.
He certainly could. About a month.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Would you like to learn them?
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
What do they look like?
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Would they be good to eat?
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
No, I won't let you do it.
My favorite memory was when we --
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Oh my God! We're dead!
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Let's get outta here.
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
He's here.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Listen to me I --
Oh.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Where's Shorty?
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
My child you are the only survivor.
I don't like this, this...
Here you go, Professor.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Professor, I think you should see this.
Professor, we need to talk.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
That's right.
Father, are you okay?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
What?
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
This part removes the sense of humor.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
"Fucked me."
Is MOM... in there?
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
No comment!
Sorry, ma'am.
I'm so happy I could shit.
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
Oooohhhh.
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Hello.
You bitch!
Who is this?
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
So you do drink?
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
Where?
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse   -- used a phony health inspector's badge  they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
You can't tell.
When I wanted to.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
She could use a hundred dollars.
I'll give you a check.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
Why, Mary --
What brought you down here, Greg?
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
I'm going to find your sister.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
Who are you?
I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.
Please, Jacqueline.
Good-bye.
You'll be all right?
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
Not I - I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano - "My courage like a white plume"  and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.
Uhhuh.
What?
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
Yes?
Television?
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
You are?
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Aren't you?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
All of these are interviews?
Like what?
Don't you want to make one?
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
It won't. Are you ready?
I guess not.
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
About me?
Yes.
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
On tape?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
And now you can?
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
And you feel the same way with John?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Why not?
Yes.
Yes.
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
I can't tell you like this.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
Graham...
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
John?
Well, are you?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Why don't I believe you?
You've made your point.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
I want out of this marriage.
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
I have thought about it, yes.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
Yeah, so?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Do you have to say that?
I have a pretty good idea.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Did he touch you?
No, but I did.
You couldn't do it, period.
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
I don't want to discuss it.
No, I touched me.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
I just want to ask you questions.
And that's all?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Yes.
Okay.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
Maybe.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
Cynthia. John.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
No.
It won't. I trust him.
Did he put you up to this?
Student?
Plus first and last month deposit.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Really. How'd it go?
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
One moment.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Medical clinic?
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Kiss, kiss?
Another kiss?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
Where is he now? Do you know?
Can I call you at the office?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
NIGHT NIGHT
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
We're the experts.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
That's us.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
Poor Brad.
I'm sorry, Officer.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
YOUNG BLOOD
Flavors!
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
THAT MINIMAL
This could be worse than the old series.
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Yeah, I'm here.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
What do you think?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
I'd rather have a knife.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
When do we get to drink it?
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Yeah. Tight.
Shut up.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
With Maya?
Well, she is cute.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
I will.  See ya!
Hey, there you are.
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Nope.
What is it?
Is what the money thing?
It's private.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
What's it look like to you?
You know what I'm thinking?
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
She tell you she was married?
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
The plan is... you go.
Me?
Whatever. Sorry.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
You want to join us?
I finished it.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Hi.
What was the bottle that did it?
Yeah. Thanks.
A paper?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
See you over there, Miles.
About a year.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
Daddy.
It tastes funny.
Hi sweetie.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
Are you going to do this or what?
No I'm not.
Pharmacy crowded?
Where are you going?
Should we make a run for it out the back?
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
No.
Graham.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
I'm getting out now.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
Okay.  So he was tall?
I don't think so.
And three weeks.
No money, eh?
I think we lost 'em.
I didn't know you were out.
Sounds good.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
They've been kind to me.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Women?
You might make a farmer yet.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
What now?
All I did was kiss the girl.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Rae, I need help.
What makes you think I could?
Why him?
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
And I know what I'm talking about.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
What do you mean?
I don't want you to get hurt.
I've got a place I can hide her.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
I'm glad we talked.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
"Forever".
I'll send you her resume.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
-- I can explain.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
She said you were very beautiful.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
I'm sorry.
-- We call them "vactors".
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
I do.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
What?!
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
You love her, don't you, Max?
It's a hotel.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Yes.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
You did create me.
The only real truth is in the work.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
Dr. Crowe.
Congratulations.
Why?
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
You said the "s" word.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
When?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
No.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
Don't go home, okay?
They're right here.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Where is she?
They scare me too sometimes.
They?
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Superstition.
Chicken blood on the crops.
See?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
No shit.
Sounds familiar.
I could. You sucked.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
So... what does it do?
You'll be back.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
Amends...?
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Down boy.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Chicken sandwich?
Is that right?
Name something.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Let it go.
No --
Mac... let's get out of here.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Second verse!
Where's Mac?
Carl.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Whatcha' doin'?
Oh, yeah?
How about Brenda?
Sorry.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
What's he get if he wins here?
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
You got my barley pop?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
Where you from?
Seriously?!?
What the hell are you doing?!?
You could've asked.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
Kate...
Ummm?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Why should I?
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
I'll do it.
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
How long's this gonna take?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
I hate to say it...
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Never mind. It's nothing.
We're outta motion lotion.
Talk to me.
Go head on, breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Where the hell are you?
Shut up, Fred.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
How bad?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
But there were more of you?
Really?
Man, that's great.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
I said I got his machine.
I am. Yeah.
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
-- You can and you will.
...Are you insane?
...So you made another deal?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
Yeah... Sid?
-- he's doing it then, huh --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
True?
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
What were you doin' here anyway?
Why?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
Bulllllshit...
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
What's the time frame?
She'll come back.
How quickly?
How much sleep do you need?
How much sleep?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
No.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
Just get him to stop.
Yes.
When did this happen?
We're taking a flight?
You didn't look very happy.
Stop it.
Rheya.  Not here.
Then it's God, right?
What happened?
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
Yes.  Yes.
Who have you been talking to?
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
What do I have to do to stop it?
I want you here.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
I can't --
What are you taking?
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
Hi.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
Would you pick one out, please?
Beg pardon?
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
Tell it like it is.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Pretty bad.
... Mike.
Claire!
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Your what...?
What are you talking about?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
What about when she goes out?
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
Even Joey Venza?!
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
No, sir...
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
What're we having?
Lay back, Mack.
Okay, I guess.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
So, what are you doing tonight?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Sexual tension...
Peter-- you took this picture?
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Flash, drop it--
Lizzy!
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Can we make it a hundred?
Frmpph-yrr.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
He knew.
Some things you should say anyway.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
But you like that in a man?
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
What's your problem?
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Hello, Liz.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
I am old enough to--
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
How is he?
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
My self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Mr. Parker.
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Bonkers.
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
Ready?
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
My legs are frozen.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
You were saying --?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Let me go! Let me go!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
That's what I wanna hear.
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Let me alone.
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
May I have this dance, Miss?
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
Let me do it, Hoffy.
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
You told them, Hoffy.
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Are you questioning me?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
We have no radio.
What guy?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
You heard him.
Twelve years, sir.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
Well?
Data, are you all right?
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
These are my children...my children.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
Better?
That's right.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
I thought you might.
Kirk here.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Sir?
Captain, are you all right?
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Still no response, sir.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Hello, sir. It's David.
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
What is it?
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
That may be difficult...
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
Count on our help, sir.
About a dozen officers and men.
What about surface life signs...?
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.

Who is this?! How dare you --
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Share this with no one.
Understood, my lord.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
How can you tell that?
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Sir, may I --
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
Physician, heal thyself.
That's all you have to say?
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
I told you! I told you I saw a --
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
What?
Let go -- he can't -- !
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
<u>WHY</u>?
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
A distinct possibility.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
Khan!
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Stop engines.
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Admiral on the bridge --
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
You lied.
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
You sure this is such a bright idea?
What do you mean?
It'll come back to him.
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
-- That's the general idea.
It doesn't look all that different.
What did you say she was getting?
Wake up, man, wake up!
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
... I don't think he understands...
Like what?
Name?
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
Hm?
What's that?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Where are you going?!
Surely you can be more specific...
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
I cannot tell a lie.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Ready sir.
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
No power to the bay doors.
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Professor Scott, if you'll --
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
They are my friends.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Sulu Hikaru.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
But not you.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
A perfect moment?
You're what?
I aspire to be more than I am.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
No... I want to stay with you...
I have to go home now.
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
The artificial lifeform was right?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
Implants bothering you?
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
You got me, Commander.
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
Sir?
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
You need a haircut, Commander.
One. It's Ru'afo.
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
Augh?
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Absolutely.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
Is it Japanese?
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
Vulcan?
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Dispersive armor is holding.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
I am the Borg.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
Juice?
Where?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
Always am.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
Yes.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
Something wrong with that?
There is no invasion...
"Money." So you can get dome money...
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
Captain?
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
Just a little queasy...
Right.
Report!
Good luck, Captain.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Uh, Jim...
What the Hell's going on?
Can you - ?
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
What is it with you, anyway?
If they're even looking for us...
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
And what did they tell you?
That isn't true...!
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
From Starfleet?
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Captain, if --
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
What is it?
We HAVEN'T fired -
What peace conference?
Channel open, Captain.
WE SURRENDER.
Sir?
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
That could take hours!
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Why?
When was he... created?
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
Now, you make a toast.
Data!
A bit less florid, Data.
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Why is it moving?
No.
Do you have a moment, sir?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
No.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
Not with the Romulans.
No!
Sir, we're being hailed.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
You know I need to verify this.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
I won't defend my life to you.
Why are you here?
Not so long.
I am.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Right in line with that burning tree.
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
Thank you.
How much are your rooms?
Do you have children?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
No, we don't.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Mrs. Haydn...
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Please...
Gear shift.
What?
What?!
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
Who?
Shit.
A drink.
What's the matter?
I do not understand.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
No.
Why?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
What is hitchhike?
Well... I'm going to go now.
I do not want to.
I am not a good singer.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
I feel better if I move.
What are you saying?
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
I will say that we can be friends.
You want the baby to laugh at me.
How long will it take you to get home?
Well...
Call the police!!
I told you I'm looking for someone.
What? No, of course not.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Is it for real?
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
I don't understand.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
I wouldn't think so.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
I made my choice, Lenny.
You have to go.  I mean it.
Tonight.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
We should talk alone.
What?  Right Here?
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
He records himself raping and killing her--
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
What do you mean?
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
How did you hook up with Faith?
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
Who was just here?
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
What clip?  What was it?
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Are we having a bad night?
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
But that doesn't add, does it.
And what about the guy that was following me?
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
It was a tough call.
That's the original.  There are no copies.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
See you downtown.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Um... he was older.
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Agent Mackelway.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
Dylan here.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
What?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
A grill pattern.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Maybe cause he's smart.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Miss me, Dave?
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Yes I do.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
What's that?
There are Agency regulations about this.
Does Koessler ask about me?
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
Maybe we should back off a bit.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Start killing people for real?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
Jaime --
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
You knew it was me all along?
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Was it Zero?
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
Let's talk about Zero.
So you're the new meat?
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
I know, I know.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
Don't do it, Mike.
You're a comedian?
Yeah.
Well, thank you...?
Nikki.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Yeah.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
It does.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Oh. You know.
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
Always...
On the table.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Hello?
Hi, Mike?
Lorraine?
Hi. Sorry about that.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
There's the rub.
Oh no?
You want to hit the town tonight?
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
What are they doing here?
Are you ready to order?
I don't know...
You're crazy.
Vegas, baby!
Whu?
She smiled baby.
Did she, or did she not smile?
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Yea, how much?
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
What was the part?
I gotta use the phone.
Sorry about interrupting...
...a day...
I hear she's getting real fat.
What are you doing?
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
What a surprise.
So, two days?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
...and you got big claws and fangs...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
It's on...
The bear's got his claws back.
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
I ask for Justice.
But your daughter is still alive.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
You heard about your father?
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
Understood.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
Are you worried about security for your million?
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
Hey, beautiful girls!
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
Michael, what are those men doing?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
You know I love spaghetti.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
And what do you want for Christmas?
He'll be OK.
I LOVE YOU.
Can you say it?
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Don't ask me.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
How can you be sure?
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
Sure. Any time.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Uncanny!
It's vile.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Can you mix a martini?
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I met him in New York.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Freddie?
Shoes too?
I thought you'd missed the train.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Really? To Italy?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
What evening?
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Freddie, do you have something to say?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Such as?
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
What does that mean?
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
That's a terrific idea.
Tom?
What?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
My God.
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
I'm fine.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
The singer?
Well... mostly...
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
You forgot "sexy".
More people watch it.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Have you been noticing anything strange?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
This is gotta be a game, right?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
Huh?
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
Why not?
What should I do? Call the cops?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
You don't have to.
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
Also clean.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
You moonlightin?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Who?
You would, huh?
What's the action around?
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
Mason.  Mason?
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
What.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
What did... what did I want to be?
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Do you have the...
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
When did you start smoking?
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Yes it does.
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
No, sir.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Here we are.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
When did I leave?
Why?
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
Didn't you have any help?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
That's where you live.
You smell gas?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
Exactly.
Cigarette?
Not at all.
Well, that's not what they think.
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
No, I...
Tim, I have to tell you something.
That you got let go.
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
You hungry, son?
Yes.  Very.
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
Cathy?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Yes.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Different?
And what had you done?
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
I see.
Do you think I should go?
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Yes, I did.
I don't know yet.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
No, it's Lois!
See them two big trees across there?
Yes?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Daniels.
Are you sure?
I need her exact name, you see.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
No. Here's fine. 
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Tell him about the party.
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Does this room look silly?
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
He's not home.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
No, of course not.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
I think you're a louse.
Do you practice here?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
Yes, but...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
Like what?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Some cream?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
It's an uprising.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
Don't let's take any chances.
Do you want to try your father again? 
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
That... that... who was that?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
How soon?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
Help how? What do you want to do?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
I'm Donald Fettes.
I'm only a student.
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
I've heard of it.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
I remember her.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
You've no thought of going there?
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
This is not a woman!
It was a woman when we put her in.
Are you a doctor, too?
He was a nice horse.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
What did you hear?
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
She would if she could.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
You sent them. I had no choice.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
You killed her. I saw it.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
Fucking Zombie.
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
You know.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
Honey. I just can't.
What were you yelling about?
Please. Come inside.
You wrote this?
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Yes, I have!
Are you an FBI man?
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
You think they'll ever find him?
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
How does he explain that?
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Thank you... Have you any news?
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
What is it you want?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Who?
I -- I thought you were--
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
You sure about that?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Just passing through Santa Carla?
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Two down and two to go.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
We were gonna grab some food.
I'm my own man.
Look.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Still mad at me?
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
We're getting close...
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
Not funny, Sam!
Me, too.
Let's go see them.
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
You've got to put this on.
This is kind of a cool place.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Nanook...
Star.
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Dogs don't eat each other.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
What?
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
Where's the other half?
Garry's missing!
Neither will we.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Would that test have worked?
A couple of hours.
How many in their party?
Right.  Why not?
Don't let up, Childs!
How long's it been?
Tie up Clark, too.
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
What is it?
So what do you make of it?
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
Where?
I think we should go on by ourselves.
Morlocks --
Do you know where they live?
Yes.
What's it all for?
What do you mean?
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
I won't leave you like this.
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
Say I just come back again?
Why is it -- breaking up?
What?
I need to... um... talk to you.
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Alex, what is it?
I need... to talk to you.
No... let's walk through the city.
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Where's the challenge in that?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
Hiding?
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
What is it?
How long did you travel?
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
Why not?
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Did you have fires at night?
You know this?
Yes.
Yes... I suppose so.
Mara -- what -- ?!
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
And roosters.
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
No...
I am the oldest.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
You done with your small talk?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
[Beat] What's your name?
You're just gonna walk?
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
What?
Do you really believe me?
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
I know.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I have no idea.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
William, you're not making sense.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
How'd he get it?
[Beat] I don't know.
You have no idea what's going on.
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
How...how do you know?
You told me this was how it happened.
Who...who kills me?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
You ever been to jail?
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
I'm not sure.
Well, where are you from?
Why "of course"?
What's this?
You want a drink?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Uh-huh.
What?!
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Who's the nut?
Who do you think did it?
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
So how come you don't have any kids?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
I am the great and powerful Oz...
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Hello...
Will you at least see how it fits?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Whose place is this again?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Which part?
It means shut up, Thelma.
I'm cash poor.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Will I be?
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
What happened to your hair?
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Holy shit.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Thelma.
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
I... I...
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Now what what?
You mean now or before?
What little dogs?
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
Sorry!
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
You do?
Good.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
We've gone insane.
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
How far are we from Mexico?
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Shit!
You too, sweetie, the best.
What?!
We're not giving up, Thelma.
We been seein' you all along the way.
We're fine!  How are you?
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
The thing's kind of heavy.
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Stop it!
Good-looking?
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Got cash.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Mary.
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Very nice.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
How'd you know that?
I beg your pardon?
No, I mean
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
You're a movie buff?
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Come on, what were you going to say?
All set.
Uh-huh.
All you want is a phone number?
No.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Nope. Never been.
Four kids, three different guys.
Miami?
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
Your turn?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
What do you mean?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
Nice.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
What?
Oh... Sully.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
I can live with those reflections.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
No I'm not.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
What's he like?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
Hi, Ted.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
So you're a writer?
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Why not?
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Get over here.
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
What?! No please, sir --
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
No, no, please!
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Eh.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Piggyback ride.
See you, Warren.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
What's it about?
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Secretary of Defense...
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
I don't like what's happening.
What's that?
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
Who are you?
What journey?
Maisy Blue Legs place?
How'd you know?
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
Her oil pan is shot.
Thanks, Cooch.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Crow Horse, listen --
Where was this?
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
This Jimmy's?
Who did?
What?
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
No way. No fuckin' way.
I'll bet!
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
I beg your pardon.
You saw a MiG 21?
Where were you?
It never came up.
You let me make a fool of myself.
What would?
Apology acknowledged.
I can't.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
How about what?
You're totally insane.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
What?
What kind of games?
Want to play the game?
That's three.
I was, later.
Remember one thing.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
What are you doing?
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
You go. I'm staying with it.
Is it you?
What do you want?
Why do you all have such funny names?
Who's your pilot?
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
What was that?
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
What are you doing?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
1000.
I was a victim of circumstance.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
I think I can work it out on my own.
You didn't help.
Sir?
I lost.
All right.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
You think I shouldn't fly.
Need a ride?
Get it, please.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
No, sir.
Stop fighting and get out.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
What do you want?
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
You open it.
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Where's Kuato?
What, aliens?
Shit!
What are you, my father?
Harry, what the hell is this?
Are you saying she liked it?
Would you please repeat the destination?
Mmmm.....
Let me go!
...You mean it?
Lori, move.
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Oh God, Doug.
I suppose you're not here either.
I love you.
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
All right.
Go on.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Don't be ridiculous.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Where's this "reactor" come from?
...Who are you?
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Yeah, still got one poking around.
What the hell is that, anyway?
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
You didn't cook breakfast?
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Jeez, look at that guy.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Oh, Jesus!!
You go north, I'll go south.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Watch your ass, shithead.
What the hell are you doing?!!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Burt!  Heather!
You sure this is where it was?
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
True.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
Come now. Did you see the gun?
You can't remember that -- !
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Of course.
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
Ten years is a long time.
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
...What do you mean?
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
I embroidered.
-- About what?
How can I tell you what I don't know!
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
'lo, Cecil.
See-cil.
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Was there an argument?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
OK, Gordon.
Anything else?
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Tell me about the letter.
Someone else has it now.
He's dead -- good and dead.
How come Jack let's you work here?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
That's what I heard.
That's good.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
It's late, Sam.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
The usual, 9:15.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Maybe.
Well, why not?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
We're on our way, Baby.
Why? It does.
James...
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
Dad...
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
Yes.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
What's wrong?
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
Nothing.
How did you settle on the amount?
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
They lied.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
No.
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Nothing further, your Honor.
No further questions.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
...I was one of a group of...
Anything special about the case?
Tell me one?
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
Thank you for seeing me.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
The TV didn't work.
You're going to stay here...?
Not if you don't grow up...
If I don't 'grow up...'
It's over!
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
From the magazine?
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
...I'm sure you do...
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
Yes. Yes, I have.
I want to buy you a drink.
Hi, Mickey...
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
...Gruber's not bad.
Right.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
What did she do?
What?
Huh.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
We'd be in all the papers!
Hey, how about that!
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Did it do you any good?
Aw, he isn't that good...!
What's he like?
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
They've blocked it!
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
Colonel - shooting's no good!
They are living creatures out there.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Must be somebody in there.
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Chase, you'd better come home.
Like what?
Yes.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
Why does God let there be bad things?
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Right 'cross the freeway.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Darker.  More...evil?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
The car's no there yet?
Heather, what is it?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Coffee'd be nice.
Your father?
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
I didn't know sir.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
We all have problems.
Yes.
What the hell is going on?
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
My dad.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Son-of-a-bitch.
Why, man?
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
How long you been standing there?
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
Sorry to hear it.
No.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
What's she doin' here?
What's the name of it?
Club Zanzibar.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
What?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
That bastard Pucinski...
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
So?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
What's that, honey?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
What's that, peanut?
Oh shit...
How'd you know my daddy?
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Yeah?
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
You sick?
You been drinkin', huh?
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Have it your way... But you want it.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Where? In the leg?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Yes.
Put your shoulders back.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
So?
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Well?...
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
He's fine. He's narrating.
It's the Chancellor.
Emily?
She's a transvestite.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
You must be mistaken.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
Vernon.
'Fraid so.
Boy or girl?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Sure.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
No! What gave you that idea?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
Sounds like a good one.
So what are you doing out here?
Is that really it?
Go ahead.
They're glass. The buttons.
Yea, James.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
But... ?
Washed up?
Professor Tripp?
How did I get here last night?
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
I never said that.
I didn't mean it that way.
No thanks.
I thank you.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Jesus.
But where? I need the street.
I'm sure.
Is that Cristaile?
Who's gun is that?
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
And what do you think you might have said?
I'm through improvising.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Did you just make that up?
I need a ride.
It's Grady, Walter.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
Excuse me?
Is it good?
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
The birthday party.
Aren't you glad?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
You don't have to tell me this.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
Their sound is quite musical.
I'd love to hear it.
Something like that.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
I'm not pretty.
What does that mean?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
So. How are you adjusting?
No thank you.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
Does he?
Why not?
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
I don't feel anything.
Do you think you're crazy?
Will I ever be normal?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
Nothing.
This is garbage!
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
Me?
I'm just quiet.
You never spoke to me before.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
What about bears?
I'm not easily shocked.
So... what's your dark secret?
You think I have a problem?
The worst?
So, what did you do?
Sorry.
You don't really --
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
What odds?
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
You never asked them about it?
Neither am I.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Sneak up behind me like that.
She-hit.
Okay so far.
Lord Almighty.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Need some help?
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
Try again.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Son of a bitch!
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Oh God, Lins... I--
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Why bring it here?
Is that it?  Is this right?
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Stand by on the ROV.
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
Did you sleep well?
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
Find anything?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
Are you joking?
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
Claudia, let's get married?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
That's why I asked you...
I love you.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
You say that just to flatter me.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Please, you come too...
But for what reason should I come there?
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
And what are we going to do now?
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
We have a radio like this, too.
Thank you.
Are you the owner of this place?
What boat?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
You really must do me this one favor.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Who tells you these things?
That's not what he meant.
It made them holy.
No.
I burnt them.
No I don't.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Yes.
Where?
I fell asleep.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Do you know a Marie?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
You'll laugh.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you?
Because I don't want one.
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
I'm not sick.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
Answer me!  You never answer me.
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
She can.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
No I'm not.
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
Of telling you.
It came out of me.
No.
Because I wasn't worthy.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
What do you think it's there for?
Of what?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Where?
I hate him...
For what he made me go through.
Yes.
Yes.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
It's your favourite...
Who are you?
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
Do you still go to church?
... Thank you.
Yes.
I haven't a clue.
Could there have been anyone else?
Why do you think that?
I am not with the Inquisition.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
Shortly after she came to us.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
Oh, some time in January.
Oh, Dear God...
Your niece!
We'll see about that.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
I'd like to begin.
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
You think she's a saint?
The father!
But how did it happen?
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Why would I lie?
Of course, John.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
They are?
Just you?
What about all these letters?
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Ever seen one of these before?
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
What's that mean?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Books are good!
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
What?
What are you doing?
What are they saying?
Hello, Grandfather!
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Hiding.
Gie's a kiss!
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
My eyes are lighter.
Aye, but you know him well.
I knew I could rely on you.
Y'what?
Where's my grandfather?
That's mine.
Well ...
But...
Yeah, down the ... er ...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
What is he?
Oh... God... am I cold...
Locked.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Computer, what language was that?
What do you mean?
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
And when will you be ready to do that?
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
No, I don't want us separated.
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
Where did it come from?
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
Can you do anything for him?
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
We've got six hours left.
Oh my God.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
This is horrible.
That must have been when he got it.
Recognizable!  In that?
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
Is it armed?
Air lock?
What'd he say?
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
Let's hear it.
Good!  Moisture content?
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
What film?
Where did the parasites come from?
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
Food-storage room!
What's it doing, having a seizure?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
Better?
Is it dead?
I found it...
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Something spooking the rhinos?
Wait.  Lost it.
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
Is that a fact.
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Do you believe him?
How's it going?
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
Give me a yell is something happens.
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
Eddie...
What a day - what a heavenly day...
D-day.
Just like it.
Almost four.
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
What of it?
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
Yes, Addison.
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
She was magnificent.
You were there? At the play - last night?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
How... how was Miss Caswell?
I take it she read well.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Huh?
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Take care of yourself out there...
Bill...
Huh?
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Knit me a muffler.
When - when are you coming back?
It's a good thought.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
Addison-!
I'm trying terribly hard.
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
Why?
Why you have to go out there.
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
Also Addison deWitt.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
- and for you.
You think?
Lemme fix you a drink.
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
You probably won't believe me.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Mrs. Richards.
Karen.
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
May I have your coat?
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
But the raves about your performance-
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I'd like to hear it.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Why not?
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
They're your fans, your audience-
Harrington.
Three or four miles...
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
Where'd you get all that information?
I'm beginning to catch up.
What's so funny?
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
I don't think I could be.
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
That's right, but I don't understand-
"Liebestraum."
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Would you?
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
But what could she do?
I didn't hear you.
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
Hmm.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Anything you've got.
I hate both parties.
Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--shit--
--I know, I know--
--shit, who do we know?--
--I haven't said anything--
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
11:30.
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
--Howard Hunt?
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
And you will.  But not now.
You can't.
I've got a lot of energy.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
I didn't.
Can't help you.
--so?
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--that was awhile ago--
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Hey... very tense.
I don't know what they'd do to me.
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
I will not talk about the other two.
I really can't talk now--
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
Same kind of crap--
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
Just tell me his title.
--I saw him. He verifies.
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
What I don't understand is how you got here.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
Where?  What do you mean, where?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Who's Colson, Harry?
So?
Anyone but Bernstein.
Howard--
Mr. Sloan?
Does "they" mean the White House?
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Sorry, coach.
Good morning gentleman.
All right, I got some scotch.
Forget it.
What?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
He likes it.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
You're so big!
Pontificated.
How do you know that?
Can I come in?
Yes.
Don't you want me to?
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Yes.
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Nadia, I can't --
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
What?
Just dial 976-Asshole.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Qualify for what?
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
What reputation?
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
The key is don't look down.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Salots! Shitfucker!
What?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Hello?
I know where he'll go.
Where?
Didn't even have to ask.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Encul d'Americain.
Or else what? You'll kill me?
Ha. Some wonder drug...
You recognize her?
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Now!
Why were you so late tonight
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
I shant!
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
Come on!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
Nervous?
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Why does everyone have to act that way?
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
How do you know?
I cursed then all!
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
You're a princess...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Please, if you'd just listen...
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
I should go
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Perhaps you could convince her?
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Oooh! Here! Here!
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
Well, no... not just, not only.
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
Right!  Where?
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Neat, yeah.
Duane?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Fifteen years, huh?
what I mean?
think that's, uh-
Yeah!
Yeah.
Okay?
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
As Balzac said...
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
H'm?
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
Yeah.
Of course.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
How is it any different?
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Well, have you ever made love high?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Let's just do it, all right?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
I didn't follow you!
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
What's- It's me, open up.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Very big spider.
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
What... huh?
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Oh, good. Okay.
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Why are you so hostile?
Commentary.
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Oh, you got a headache!
Where are you going?
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
It's a narrow view.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
What's the matter?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
You think so? Do you really?
Oh.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
Yeah.
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
Yeah.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
I was very charming.
Absolutely not.
What's that?
She's a constant surprise.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
October-ish.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Oh.
Just don't fucking tell her.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
Would you leave us alone right now?
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
When does he graduate high school?
Harry called.
Lucy overdosed.
Leave us alone right now.
I'm fine, babe.
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
We've only been over this how many times?
Well, you're a tower of support.
There's still time to undo this.
Did you invite them?
Through the sweats or not?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
Two minutes.
It's an unfair advantage.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
That is not true.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
About me!
What are you saying?
I don't look my age, Joe.
No.
What's a sign for that?
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Joking.
Ah.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Elitism?
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
I need to leave you now.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
They're nothing like us.
I don't need a drug.
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
Don't go in, Ryan.
Is there space here?
Really??
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Yeah.
Are you asking me to marry you?
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
Like the last time.
Well, something's wrong.
Um.  Happy for you.
Panes?
I didn't know you had this.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
General -- we have to talk sometime!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
You -- you think I'm right?
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Want a list?
Hlllllllp!
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
Of course --
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
Bala!
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
That's correct, sir!
Not that one.  Or that one.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Yeah, I know.
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
Shall we say -- a dollar?
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
I hope everything goes all right.
Would you like to?
Sure.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
You all right? What's the matter?
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
Why?
Here.
What is it?
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
I'm not very good at it.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
You are?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Why not?
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Are you all right?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
In this house, you're supposed to.
I know so. He's a taker.
No, I don't.
No -- just come as you are.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
I don't know.
How do you work it with the key?
Not that I have anything to hide.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
You're going to take her off my hands?
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
Naturally.
Very clever.
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
What do you want?
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
What's her name?
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Help yourself.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Well, I have things to do --
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Sleeping pills.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Will you excuse me?
You know I liked it better long.
How long has it been -- a month?
We talked about a lot of things.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
You know I do.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
Stop that, Fran.
He wouldn't.
The nerve.
What are you talking about?
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
Esprit de corps --
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
I was an FO for the 25th.
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Holy shit.
I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.
There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell.
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
I --
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
Yeah, it still runs.
Charlie?
Who is he?
No, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
A lame ?
Well, he's killing now.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
Wh -- what?
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
Hairy ?
Music?
What do you mean, Colonel?
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
Fuck no.
Go away -- hide yourself.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
You think he'd of shot us?
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
What?
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
This boat's a mess.
You're Australian?
So Kurtz is alive.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Where's your chief supply officer?
134  CONTINUED:
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
212  CONTINUED:
26   CONTINUED:
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
That's not what I meant.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Be careful, okay?
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Does he have people?
A daughter in Oregon.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
You broke the radio, remember?
Sure.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
How long has he been having problems?
Emergency room only.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
I see the help -- judgement call.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
How do you know about my mother?
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
Getting loud, getting loud.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Thanks, Melvin.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
Never.
This one has a special meaning.
Okay to say something now?
Grouchy?
What job?
I wasn't asleep!!
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Was this supposed to be your room?
No!!!
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
What the heck are those for?
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
What?
How you doing, great one?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Thanks.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
What's it mean?
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Where?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
What?
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Deadline?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
Um, five.
I work for the government.
Bullshit.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
Why?
Because he is trying to retire me.
Right.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Where you wanted to be?
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Why did you leave the Agency?
They tried to kill you?
After that?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
What?
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
That means you won't have a gun.
That's right.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
No.
I think I got one today.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
They're worth less points.
What?
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
And you were drilling these holes...?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
That's a ridiculous move.
Yes.
Yes.
What happened to her?
When did it start?
I'm not normal.
I waited another four minutes.
Hi.  Did you call --
I prefer it like this.
Do you believe that?
Sure.
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
A coke, if they have it?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Like you?
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
What's that? Free!
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
And put it on expenses?
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Can you do the lock on it?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Have you ever stolen anything?
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
I don't want to ruin your day.
Huh?
He got that one right.
You're kidding.
Siberia.
Some deal you did there!
What about me?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
It's that one isn't it.
There shooting at something.
Doug?
Good morning.
That's my mum's.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
I thought for sure they would catch me.
I don't understand, it's your home?
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Yeah, for sure.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Can we charge admission?
I figured you more as a Socialist?
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
We_re not all running away
That's right.
Why did you break into that particular building?
A drill, what are you up to?
When the hell did you write that?
What for?
I don't want to go.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
So, who is in the building?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
I'm thinking.
Don't call him a dipshit.
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
What the -- ?!
It's private.
Saturn. Beautiful.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
Hey.
Excuse me?
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
When did you build this?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
Nope.
Now? We just --
I've talked to your father.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
What's Landon Carter up to?
No. I want what's best for you.
No.
You have materials for the side bearings?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
Yes.
I'm no dummy.
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
Where did you get -- ?
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
Thank you.
This... is the number one single?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
How old are you?
Here's your jacket!
Huh?
Oh yeah.
What do I say?
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
You mean, you're gonna --
Operator...
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
A gold mine?
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
A mall?
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
That's all taken care of.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
What theater was I at?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Yeah.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
What's your friend's name?
You love him?
You still in school?
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
What a nice place.
Is that all there is to it?
You know what I think?
But it would hurt.
You tired?
It was going too fast.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
What?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Hi.
Yes.
Hi.
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
What crate?
Apache?
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
Go away.  Let me rot?
Was she pretty?
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Oh, my.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
A what?
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
How about you? Will you be alright?
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
What are they like? What are they about?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
How long you been up there, Fink?
What else?
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man  to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
Sound a little what?
...Is the egg showing or what?!
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself 
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Jesus, Charlie, I...
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik 
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
I  Mr. Lipnik 
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 
Congratulations.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
What did... What did he 
All of which he's now missin'.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
He teach you to do it?
Yeah.
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
How's not smoking?
What was she like?
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
About a year and a half.
Yes.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
My wife used to call me that.
Yes.
Why take the risk?
No.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
You workin' on another book?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Nope, can't say that I do.
Was she ever a suspect?
What kind of talk?
I never heard of him.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Catherine says you don't like her.
I don't believe it.
Catherine told me what was in it.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
Keep your three o'clock.
Fuck you, Phil.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
She's a suspect.
Who are you?
Is this finished yet?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Naa..
Do you ever get sick of it?
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Ignorant art?
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
That was my favorite part!
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Who is it?
Is Jean Michel here?
Jean, your parents are here.
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
Who am I?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry  fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
Guess I just got sick of him.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
What's wrong with me?
Hi.
What's that?
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're 
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
I'll take the whole tin.
Would you check out my studio some time?
What's your name, man?
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
That one's for you.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
Mr. Wayne ... Something wrong?
I guess this mean we won.
Where's the fire?
Hanging on every word.
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Nor I, on the second.
It does to me.
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Son!
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
Women.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
Watch the first step.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Maybe they're right.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
Master, Bruce?
What do maniacs always want?
How about, MR. E.
And another name for Mystery?
May I help you, Master Grayson?
What's wrong?
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol.  And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
La'chiem.
Just ones this beautiful.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
But...
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
Touchy, touchy.
...Not the bat?
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Bruce, you can't.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
I'll show you it works.
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
...You gonna kill me?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Go ahead. You can say it.
A-14.
Yes?
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
What are you talking about?
... Murderer...
I know. I called them.
...Not even a 'thank you'?
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
No.
Odd desire for anyone.
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
And what happens if we say no?
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
You okay?
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
Do we know anything about him?
It's the last thing we need.
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
There were three strawberries.
Liar.
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
Bye, Dad.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
... in the distant future.
Doctor Jacobson?
off the peg?
What?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
No it wasn't!
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
And Boot-Head.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Beavis.
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
They perk me right up.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Cavity search...?
Not on him, Chief.
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Cool. Huh huh huh.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
Honey.  Let's go.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
What is going on?
Wait for who?
This is <u>my</u> town.
Are you available?
All right.  Who are you?
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
We're very unhappy.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
I want to be dead too.
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
And live in what, our station wagon?
Where'd they go?
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
That's it!
God, you're anatomically correct!
What?
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
I cannot believe this.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
Maybe Charles does.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
What's happening to them?
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
There's no need for a hospital.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
My name is Chance.
No. It won't do that.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
Chauncey!
Hello, Eve.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
Yes. I like that name very much.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
I feel very good in here.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
I understand.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Oh, I see.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
... Sir?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
I agree.
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
... Hmmm... Elevator.
I see.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Yes. That is surprising.
I hope so.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Compensated...?
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
But you won't sign, correct?
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
Do you feel well enough for that?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
... How are the kids getting along?
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
This is not what I requested.
Right, Chief.
Ben!
Well, Ben... I...
Malkovich.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
She's very beautiful.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
Now?
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Tell her you need to see her.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
Sure, after a fashion.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Yex?
Security.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Is that true?
Yes, well...
Why not?
Who told you?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Tickets to Malkovich?
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Let him try.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
No.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
Think, Jew florist?
Says who?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
I'm getting divorced.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
We have to meet.
Never heard of it.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
There ain't.
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You saying nothing counts?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
YOU HURT ME.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YES.
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
You grown.
Should I wake her?
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Mama let me help you.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Can't locate him.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
Ella.
What run him off? Tell me that!
He knew Baby Suggs?
Never found out.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Who is she? Where she come from?
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Fuck.
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
Nothing.
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Uh-huh.
Nancy's pretty good.
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
Heh-heh--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
Which one was Logjammin'?
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
I thought you might know, man.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Well...yeah--
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
But he's--
Well...no, of course not--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
What the fuck are you--
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Hey man--
Hey Walter--
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
Have it your way.  The point is--
Walter!
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
That's it.  I'm out of here.
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Uh-huh.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
And the fucking money!
Dude?
You know this!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Well can we--
Dude here.
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Yeah.
Right, Dude.
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Dude.
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Well?  Aren't you?
Am I wrong!?
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
Impressive.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
how long since he was bitten?
Why do you hate us so much?
Did you think I wouldn't?
What do you think?
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Put it back in park, Blade.
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
She's been bitten.
You should've killed her, then.
Going somewhere?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
How can you be out here?
It worked, didn't it?
Is he sick?
No --
Please --
This isn't human blood.
You're a monster.
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
You've been listening in the whole time?
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
--and if she ever did--
Try, please, Anna--
What, are you alright?
Yes.
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
That's a joke?
Jesus.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
You don't want it though.
Baby names?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
How'd you know they were--
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
This is a little nuts.
--go!
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
No fucking.
What're you, crazy??
Mi casa y su casa!
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Where <u>is</u> it?
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
Where?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
Who?
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
Oooh. Oooh.
He'll never know.
What?
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
What the fuck's going on here?
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
No, I--
Yeah.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
...Where is everything?
It'll pass.
What night is it?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
I told you. I like you.
...You know that car?
Now that don't make much sense.
What do you think?
...What?
...What did you do with the bodies?
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
Of course.
Red Label.
Pour that back.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
Thanks Meurice.
...Why?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Frank. Come in.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Where are we going, Frank?
You want to see him too, right?
Those are my breasts.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Nobody.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
I . I don't know.
No.
No.
See my nipples?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Are you a bad boy?
Frank would open you.
Beeeee careful.
Sometimes I think I do.
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
No thanks.
Here's to Ben.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
There ya go.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
How is Central these days?
Terrible. boring.
What else is new?. right?
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Where are they?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Alright.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
What's the plan.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Are you sure?
Okay. thanks.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
You want to tell me about it?
Twice. without her sensing anything?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
Goodnight.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Where to?
... You look beautiful.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
... Sandy?.
Hi Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
What?
Yeah, I know.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Que va hacer?
Blanca, por favor.
Nothing like this back home.
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Surprise.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Tuna, this is crap.
Tuna, this is crap.
You can't sell this to your friends.
The coca is my responsibility!
Excuse me?
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
I don't want to talk about it.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Diego Delgado, please?
Yeah, I'm out.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Three million.  I counted it twice.
We're half a million off.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Where do I put this!?
What?
You fucked me, Diego.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Mexico.
Layaway shmayaway.
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
Beautiful girls?
Diego?
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Just low.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
I meant every word of it.
Why are you smiling?
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
No, that's alright.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
How are you doing?
You mean, like a trip?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
You swear?
I swear.  On my life.
But I have a visitor.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
I understand. What's your question?
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
Second district ... Explain better ...
What "group"?
I don't even know your name yet ...
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
I've got work to do.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
A little after eleven.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Yes.
Yes.
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
We stopped seeing each other.
No.
That's enough.
Oriental medicine.
Chinese peony root.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
What happened?
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Why'd you come here?
You know I can't talk about that.
Are you going to represent me?
Frank!
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Is it against the law?
Yes -- it would be nice.
Why would she lie?
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Rebecca -- take these off.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
I'm dropping the case.
What are they saying?
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
Really?
She sounds like quite a woman.
It had to get there somehow.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
How bizarre!
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
Well, I'd like to read them.
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Oh, yes.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
No.
No, really?
This time of year.
Mind if I smoke?
Oh. How old?
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Feeling better?
What?
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Do you miss it?
My God. How I'd love to see that.
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
My mistake. I apologize.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Take me somewhere.
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Where was she?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
I'm going to miss you.
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
They're not going to find her!
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
I said, no thanks.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
Where are we, baby?
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
Have you ever been inside?
And what's that?
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
The dead get out?
And you believe her?
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
Bill!  Bill?!
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
You were just a kid.
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Nice rack.  How old is --
No way man...
But --
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
How could that be?  The box was packed!
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
How the fuck can I open it?
The same way you did before.
Caesar!
No, Gino!
Oh, shit ...
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
She's doing the work herself.
Not bad.  What for?
Why?
It couldn't have been.
Got to think this through ...
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
I need you ...
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
What are you doing?
But everybody is all right.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Yeah?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Okay, sure, Mick.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
You got the key?
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
You're doing everything yourself?
Curious, maybe.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
No.
...  I needed that.
How long have you been with him?
Almost five years.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
What are you afraid of?
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
We're not that different, Corky.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Gino Marzzone.
That's his brother.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
I'm just asking, what if?
I won't.
Hey.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
And what if I couldn't do that?
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
Forget it.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
That's all I get?
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
MPG Capital.
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?

One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Yes.
Who?  Who came?
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
Was it the break-in?
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
Listen to what you want.
We're about an hour away.
I should go.
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
He's dead isn't he?
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
Get in the basement.
What?
That's the only angle.
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
...your ducts?
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
...ven't you?
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
In fact, killing people -
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Er, I knew you looked different.
Jack!!
Ah ...
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
And you're mine.
Do you know what you're doing.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
It could all be coincidental.
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
Are you alright?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Where are you taking me?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Security.
I thought you arrested me.
Turn!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Go away.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
But if they did promote you
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Would you really, Sam?
He is dead.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
Yes.
This is your dream girl, is it?
You haven't switched it on.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Er, don't you want to search me?
My I.D. cards.
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
You know each other a long time?
Mary said you might be coming.
Sleeping in the back.
Is this what you gave Mary?
So, Frank, am I going to live?
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
No way, man.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
He's very very sick.
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
Did you see my father?
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
You married?
Five years.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
I think the worst is over.
She's no whore, Marcus.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
Three legs.
Last show of the night.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
I don't like being handled.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
Hi.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
I don't like the word gay.
Which would you prefer?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
What happened?
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Yes.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Do others feel that you did well?
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
Just when do you start, telling people?
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Jane?
But thanks.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
We could...
Because...
No, I don't think so.
How do I get out of here?
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
...good-bye then.
I'll speak to you.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
Hi.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
Billion.
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
So you like me, huh?
At least kiss me when you do that.
Uh-huh.
How can you say that to me?
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Uh-huh.
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
A girl with a body like mine?
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
See you later -
Thank you.
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Just about anything, Walter.
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
Would you pose for me for free?
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
Yeah.
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
I don't have another cat!
Well...why murdered man?
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
Police officer.
You're like an undercover guy!
Telling you what?
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
I saw your...cat.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
After that we go no more!
I get it Walter.  I get it.
What do you get?
Hello Mayolia.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
If you see him.
What's all the noise in here!
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Don't grab me, okay?
Booo!
No, we didn't.
You think?  Split?
Invite me in, Pike.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Which way did she go?
Excellent.
Yeah, I guess.
What's Bobby gonna say?
You okay?
You broke up with my machine?
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
For the dance.
Come again?
I crashed your party.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
I forgot.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Wait!
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
What, um...  What do we do?
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Who we gonna beat?
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
Buffy...
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Five?
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
As for example, what?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
Come one, that was so weird.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
Really?
I don't understand.
I'm just a girl.
What happened?
So, we're stupid now?
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
The right nostril.  Good.
My right nostril?
Just till I lose.
That's my leg.
I'd like you to meet my father.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Crash, I didn't think you--
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
See my hips?
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
You got me all confused.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
Who are you?  Do you have a job?
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
And now you wanta teach me?
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
What?
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Fastball.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
How come you don't like me?
Naw...
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Can I ask you something?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
It's time you started working on your interviews.
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
You fuck!
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
Step outside, pal.
Where's Ebby?
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
Eight and twenty-four.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
Thank you.
What are you talking about?
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Hey!
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
I don't know.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Yeah.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
Okay?
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Hello.
It's me.
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
You've got to stop her.
I...
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
We can't get rid of him?
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
To Abraham Lincoln.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Okay.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Yeah.
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
Yeah, how do I know?
You can't make me stop caring...
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Okay, okay.
Hello.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
I gotta tell ya...
How serious?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Mm-hm.
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
With Jennifer.
To the Riviera.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
Listen to me.
Fuck you.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
...and hypocrisy.
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
So, you're a righty?
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Well, I've been busy. 
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Fucker!
You just - Just stop him.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Leave me alone!
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
I know.
He's good. He's fine.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Fine.
Hi, how are you?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Okay.
You're so nice. 
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Nothin'.
Yeah?
Okay.
I did what you told me to.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
You fucked with me for the last time!
What's the matter?
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
They check in alone?
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Why?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
You walk past me?
They're havin' a good time too.
He's here.
You must have drunk too much.
Yeah.
You're a little confused?
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
What's the matter with you?
You're probably right.
How heroic of you...
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Wha-at?
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Car wash, Captain?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
You think so?...Selina?
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
Spooky.
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
For when the time comes..
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
Any place.
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
You never miss a trick.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
Bullshit.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
Stop throwing names at me.
What do they need her for?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
What about the others?
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Our house always needs touching up.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Does she wear glasses?
What's happening?
What bank?
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
It's locked.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Know what else is in here?
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Just relax.
Satisfied?
I don't know what you mean.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Yeah?
What does it take to kill you?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Government business?
Undercover.
I thought so.
See that, Col?
What would you call it?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
Do you mean that?
What's it to you?
Scottish?
Who's she?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
You old-fashioned?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Must be in love to manage that.
He lived here with you?
As different as it's possible to be.
No.
You want to know how I kissed him?
What is this?
Dil --
I said stop it.
What you doing, Jimmy?
Do you like me even a little bit?
Prescription. For my condition.
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
In a manner of speaking.
Promise?
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Meet Col --
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Leave me alone, Jude.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
I know.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
Of course. I forgot.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
So he knows your name?
Would make me feel better about it.
Definitely unusual.
And who is she?
Right.
Fuck you.
So, what do I look like?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
How did you know it was her?
What's that?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Hey --
What is it now?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
And you know the funny thing?
She'd be anyone's type.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
Do you?
I've often wondered how you do it.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
What?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Hurling --
What if I did?
I never know nothing.
It was fun while it lasted.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
I said shut the fuck up --
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
That's right.
Adam!
You don't look so bad in this light.
Why do you think I brought you here?
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Why?
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
So that was it.
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Ours.
Oh, I see.
But --
Were you followed?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
That's the spirit.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Oh. Then who's this one?
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Very good.
No.
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Yes.
What now?
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Reggie -- listen to me --
I'm not fifteen.
Said what?
What are you doing?
That sounds like their problem.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
I think Tex did it.
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
Alex --
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Shut the door!
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Are you going to listen?
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
In money.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
I don't know.
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Did you?
Oh, la.
Up there! It is up there!
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Oh. I guess.
How do you know?
Come on. You can't stay here.
What are you doing in here?
I don't think I follow you.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
What was what?
What your husband was mixed up in.
Where?
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I never fucked Rod.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
I get all your CDs.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
One more time.
So?
It won't happen again.
Hi honey.
You found her?
This will relax her.
Can you describe her? How old was she?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Pay no attention to me.
Really?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Mark Shale.
I was desperate. It was gross.
He says he loves me.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
FINE. Are you?
What?
Mark invited me to the party.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
This place is empty.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Don't you think it's sick?
Cut it out.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Sharon's far from a slut.
My dad's down there!
Go to the police station!
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
Two men left town right after it happened.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
He could've called first.
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Why don't I--?
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
I need your truck.
...and a shitload of ice.
...-tana.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...truck.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.

Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
What the hell's goin' on?
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
You stole this truck! That's...
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
You're nuts, goin' back there!
What?

All right.
Kiss my ass!
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...

...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Come on!
Come on, old Pete.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...Pete!  Come on.

 Oh...
...ho!
Hang on!
All right.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
Yeah...


Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...overdrawn bank accounts.
 Yeah.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
I mean, if that gun was...
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
A-And you  owe me...
Ow!  
Are you all right?
Listen, Arlo.
We're gonna die!
 Okay.

Come here.
Go, go, go! 
...to him. 
We!
Whoo!
What the hell?
Shoot me. 
Mason.
...-ta get outta here!
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
You.
Thank you.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
Be cool.  Be--
Well, well, well.

 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
...take my sorry old truck.
...here.   Mason... 
You-You can't let him...
You got a prob-...
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
Thank you.
...owe you.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
...to be off the island tonight.
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
You have my word on that.

...that.
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
So far, ye-yes.
Do you know what'll...
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
There.
It's clean.
This was supposed to be a...
I'm on it.
...-fall.
 But...
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
....-lene.
I want you to look at one another...
I don't see my container.
...and unharmed, de-...
...-spite the mouth.





...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
...-time,  remember?
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
Kabula's out.
 ...that tunnel.
...son.
It must've happened right after we left.
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
Who's your suspect?
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?

He's brains without ambition...

So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
We've got the real thing!
Forty-seven.
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
Mason.  Mason!
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...to talk, son.
Let me see your...
...hands!
 Listen, Pappas...
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
Gimme this god-...
 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
Negative.  Negative.
Then these are all new owners?
Always?
It doesn't hurt.
Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
Where from?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Too bad?
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
I'll just tell my wife.
Then what'll you do?
I've been wanting to meet you.
That's just lovely.
Where did you get this material?
Hello, Jake.
How are you, Lou?
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
I don't want it anymore.
How do you happen to know her?
I want the rest of the pictures.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah?
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
I guess not.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
What are you having?
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
You left your keys in the ignition.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Another satisfied client?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Never forgave him for what?
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
I'll stay.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
When was the last time?
As little as possible.
Where?
Just... I have to.
The Albacore Club.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
How do you know?
Walsh here?
Where'd he go yesterday?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Of course.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Yes...
That's a long fall.
Come again?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
Yes. No.
He did or he didn't?
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
You don't say?
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
But you don't have any kids!!!
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
Did you ever see her again? 
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
I might make him nervous.
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
It didn't end very well, did it?
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Ask them to sit down.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
Oh!
On the chiffonier.  Here.
No.  But you're close.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
I work at Seligman's.
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
Get Dr. Corey.
It's been a tough day.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Yes?
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Brad, you are drunk.
Are you finished?
I know you will.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Was he in love?
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
That must have been love.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
Queer?
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
Millions - if anybody wants it.
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
It's not the same.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
You can hold me down.
Exactly.
So where is he?
Why aren't there any lights?
He was?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
It's not what you think.
No, you're not really getting married?
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
You lie.
Look how full of yourself you are.
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Let me take you out tonight.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Who doesn't?
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
You're late.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
Eight and a half?
She called me Brad.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Chess team Allan Harris?!
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
I'm talking to myself here.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
You know what I just watched?
Return of the Jedi.
Blasphemy.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
It would stand to reason, yes.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
There's more?
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
And you figured it out?
What did he say?
What's a jizz-mopper?
Can we talk about this later?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Pull my laces tighter.
Helluva game!
Jesus.
What!?
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Shut the hell up.
No!
His dick was in his mouth?
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
Her fucking body fell out!
Why should I loan you my car?
What's that for?
May I be blunt with you?
What the fuck did you do that for?
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
Holy shit. That girl?
Because I'm happy.
You're happy?
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
She said she did all the work.
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
You should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
Leave her out of this.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Helluva day.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Are you open?
Excuse me?
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
How do you know that?
I should start.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
You calling me a liar?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Actually, it is kind of rough.
The porno mags?
Why did you agree to come in then?
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
What were you doing up so late?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
She called you, didn't she?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
How many?
How many girls have you slept with?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Including you?
It better be up to and including me.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
Please calm down.
Lower your voice!
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
What time do you get finished?
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Here you go.
What are you talking about?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
No way.
What did he say?
What part of Russia?
Sure. How about the beach?
You're not?
He didn't ask me to...
Says who?
Like hell you are!
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
That woulda been cool.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
I love you, too.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
What are we going to do?
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
He doesn't want my help.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
How'd you get up here?
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
It was great.
You attacked me.
Gabe!  Are you alright?
No luck?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Never
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Then where the fuck is!
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
You got what we need?
No names, this is an open line!
Good morning, Walt.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
No. She's dead!
Help you.
Who are they, sir?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
Let me get up.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Lice?
You're absolutely right, sir.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
And when do I get out of here then?
You're keen on music?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Mothballs, sir.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Max, the cab driver!
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
No.
Oh, my, yes.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
What?  What did you say?
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
So?  It was a random thing.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
It's nothing.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
I've been calling and calling.
You're gonna cheer up.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
You mean like benefits?
Max.
You're cool.
Got it?
What?
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
How about the thingy next to it?
You better?
58th and Central.  You know it?
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
So what?
No.
What you mean, no?
What difference does it make?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
I don't know.
Who's Heller?
Yeah, that.
One more.
What'd they do?
As in...? 
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
The sound of love.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Do you still ride?
I can't promise you anything.
What was your horse's name?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
What is?
For what?
He says a dog bit his nose.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
You want something to drink?
Equitation.
Who?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Shoot.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Not this again.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You made your decision yet?
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Excuse me?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
Night after that?
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
Tell me about it.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
There's no plug to pull.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
David --
David --
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
Got a bogey, boss?
Ellie.  Pulsar?
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Talk to him.
Could we hear to the moon?
Can you show me?
So.  What happens now?
That isn't the way it works.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
No more stalling, Captain.
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
I didn't realize I was out.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
And?
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Ellie.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Maybe you're creating a monster.
You're willing to die for this.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
The final countdown.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
I can't do this --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
I can't hear this now --
I'm not sure it's come to that.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Gotta have kings.
Go hard!
Go git it, Luke.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!
But there's still daylight left.
A cold drink.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
Take it easy, Drag.
It's good medicine.
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
We've got another one.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
What's that siren?
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
Who's the married man?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
I'll get a locksmith.
Open the door.  Please.
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Because it's your job, that's all.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
What's wrong with him?
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence...
Where were you?
Outside in the visitors, car park.
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
What's up with you?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
What about the engagement party?
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
I gather he's late as usual.
Tomorrow?
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Must you walk so quickly?
There's a spider in my room.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
You took bets on my diagnosis?
He asked me to marry him.
Shocking, huh?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
I have a terrible confession.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
The store was busy.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
What?
And all the plans we have.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
Can you loan me a 20?
That's a big question.
Yes, I suppose so.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
It doesn't matter who.
Here's the ring.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Where did they go?
Oui.
No.
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Good.   I'm good.
Why are you here?
And?
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I assume you want something?
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I only have your word for that.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Hopefully no one.
No.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
You haven't answered my question.
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
-- Did you set it up?
Hey boss, it's not a science.
What'd they take?
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
The Holiday Hotel.
This kind.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
I'll drive.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Get in the car.
No.   It's mine.
Holy shit.
The money isn't here.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
J&amp;B?
Glenmorangie.
You ask a lot of questions.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Can't sleep?
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
You're back!
I don't care about your sword.
Where's your master?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
What's it to you?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
Don't bother.
You don't seem to understand.
Please sit.
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
I've missed you.
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
Let's end this here.
Give it back!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
Let's stop a moment.
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
Let them look.
What was it?
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
No.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
What about you?
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
A murderer?
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
My name.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
In a better place.  I hope.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
T-Bird?
I can see her.
I wish to possess what you have now.
Neither.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
You might say that.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You didn't show it to anybody?
You promise not to say anything?
No.
Why not?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
I sincerely doubt it.
I never said that.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
It was fine.
I'm busy.
That's also none of your business.
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
What are you doing?
Okay.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
What?
"I actually feel good about myself?"
Why are you doing this?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
I just came to say goodbye.
Where are you going?
What are you saying?
Outstanding.
What are the boys like?
What are you scared of?
That was cool.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
Why?
Cecile, you have to tell me.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
What are you doing?
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
You promised to let me kiss you.
But -
Am I suppose to be this sore?
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Yes!
Pretty sure or sure sure?
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
Ronald?
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Care to make a wager on that?
What are the terms?
Call me later.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You wanted an answer to your question.
It's Cecile.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
What time is it?
You're a lucky guy.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
Oh, hello.
I love the smell of pine.
What are saying, darling?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Mommy --
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
What?
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I live right here.
It was just a voice.
I shall want you for always.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Your children?
Look at my ring.
Will you come soon?
But she's such a nice lady.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!
No, thank you.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
What?
Hurry, hurry.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
What else is there?
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
Maybe he's just shy.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
So did you do it?
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
So where's this infamous arm now?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Get rid of him!
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
Guess she never found true love.
No. I won't let you do that.
I'm really tired.
Yes I do have to pee!
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
Look what you did!
This really isn't a good time.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
Did you change your hair?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
No.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
What are they for?
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
What's that supposed to mean?
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
We can get a warrant if you like.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You're some catch Lloyd.
He was found a few blocks away.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
What?
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
What are you talking about?
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Ill be the judge of that.  Anything else?
I didnt requisition a secretary.
You typed this report?
It seems fine.
Where are we going?
Which one?
Yes.
I didn't realise...
You know something about me?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Oh... I'm fired?
A condition...
Clean.
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Dave -- I'm working.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Will he be alright?
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Does it make the cars any better?
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
Really?
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
What are you staring at?
Don't you have anything to say to me?
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
You're leaving?
Where are you going?
You really believe that?
Yeah.   He's a good man.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
You fired that shot, didn't you?
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Don't come.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Yeah?  Like what?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
You what?!  How did you do that?
What happened?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
But, Chris...
Chris!
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Uh-huh.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
I didn't know you taught.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
Again!  Louder!
Don't stop!
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Isn't there an easier way?
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
My brother went here.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
Yes.  But
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
What is that supposed to mean?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
From my father and Nolan.
Put more into it!
Not an option.
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Then who are you?
Noooo!
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Anti social?
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
The "come back" kind.
No...
Shut up! You hear me!!
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Joey...it's okay...
Joey... Which way's aft?
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Joey...
Or maybe not.
What was that?
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
She fucked us both.
That's mustard!
Ammo! Get the ammo!
Who's full of shit?
I know, but...
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
I got delayed. I --
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
I have to go.
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Yeah?
Hey, Nick...
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Sal.
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Linda, what's the matter?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Linda, Linda...!
What?
What kind of beer would you like?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
No-o-o!
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
This is horrible!
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
You should have put that on last night.
Huh?
You think about it?
The shot?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
Merle...
No way. No fucking way!
No. No way!
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
No.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
What did you say?
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Who is it?
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
What's this?
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Hello Wade.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
Does it drive itself, too?
I have to go home, Sanchez.
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
How then?
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
How do I look?
Yeah.
You okay?
Demolition Man.
Seat's too high.
Belle --
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
Gee -- that Fair --
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
No! No! I won't.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
No. She's gone.
Never mind. What's your name?
What's the matter with you?
Afraid ... of what?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
You know darn well it is.
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
Not long -- now.
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
But -- I was just lucky.
Yes.
Down, Shep! Down!
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
I am going to lock him up.
Why don't they come --
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
What's that you say, Son?
You'll be a father any minute now.
Let him try it.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
Hullooo!
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
Why don't you?
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
Nothing...
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
I'm a cop from New York.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
Holly Gennero?
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
How do you know?
What's going on?
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Is that him?
No.  I never smile any more.
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
Well, how'll I get home?
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
That's it.
Why you going to Algeria?
Would you do something for me? Please?
What?
I gotta listen to it if they think...
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
You don't have a choice?
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
You try calling the police?
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
I can't talk to him.
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
... armed robbery ...
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
Yeah?
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
You like me?
We like you, too.
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
You were terrific, too!
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
My body?  What for?
Ah, Jesus...
Dead or alive?
I never been up in a plane before.
Get over there!
What'd he say?
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Okay, Sonny.
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
Okay - you got your one.
Oh - Maria!
I forgot she's in here.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Here's your document, Sonny.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
We can't stay here.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
Doing what?
Robbing a bank.
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
Where are we going?
<i>He killed two children.</i>
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
<i>What happened to them?</i>
What?
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
You're a drunk fool.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
I thank you.
Mookie.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
No.
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
I'll do.
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
ML stands for ML.  That's it.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Do we now?
I work too, but I still make time.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Later for you.
Meda.  Meda.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
You talk to 'em.
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
That's the dope.
Get the broom.
I'm listening.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Then we could try something else.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
Pop asked you.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Hi.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Just down the hall.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Mom, you know that never works.
Home school. Til today.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Yeah, he's a pirate.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Where did you learn that word?
No.
I don't know. Owwww.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
HARRY, can you hear me?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
Me, me, me!
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
I made the polar bear pants.
Wait, wait!
Try one in a million!
You had some questions.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Special Needs class.
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Me too. I'm almost there.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
You know I do!
How was that?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
It's the big potato.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
Who's there?
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
You know the ancient tongues?
No.
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
We surprised a band of smugglers.
The Voice again.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Uh, beg to differ.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Really?
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
I don't understand.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Should I call a doctor?
What's in the needle?
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Why are you here??
Don't you have any savings?
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
You really think so?
This is kind of a stream--
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
This is my way of telling you --
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
You're a fuckin' mess.
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Mr. Wood?!
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
Tor, I should be getting home.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
What is happening?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Um, I guess --
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
Oh, it's you again.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
No! I love sex with girls.
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Let's get married.
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
Isn't that the same thing?
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Who?
Yeah, so... ?
They celebrated the common person.
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You know what would be great?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Uh-huh?
Sure.
You know who we are?
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
So he killed himself.
Eddie? ...
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
I can't believe you're taking his side.
He says --
She could've been a nurse.
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Eddie...
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
But Al is your husband now!
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Our what?
What are you doing?
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
I hear the dog really liked him.
So?
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Really?
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
What's up?
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
Screw off.
Great.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
I know.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
No -- keep it.
Hello.
What...
Hi.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Ohhh...
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
Yeah, just --
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Dick... Dick,..
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
Tracy.
Thanks for everything.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
Why are you lecturing me?
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Hello, Mr. M.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh, Jim?
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
Where 're you going?
Are you crazy?
People can see this.
For what?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Yes, Paul?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Paul, get out!
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
Till 19-fucking-70.
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
Merry Christmas.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
I'm not sure.
Look.  I want to see you again.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
So tell me about it.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Yeah, I hate them.
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
How what, Wendell?
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
What are you talking about?
What was that boyfriend's name?
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
You wanted to meet here?
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
She's fine.
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
That's right.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
Anything?
Believed what?
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
I don't own no shotguns.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
Gone.  Not a trace.
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
And?
You're wrong.
No.
No.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
So what's the point?
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
No.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Some reality.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Do you have any proof?
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
My daughter was a virgin!
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What's wrong, Trash?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Brill?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
I just gave him my card.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Yes.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Wait. What do I do?
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
I'll pay you.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
Jesus!
What'd I tell you?
What do you think?
Looks like Detroit.
The NSA killed him.
Them.
Where?
<u>Here</u>?!
No he won't.
What if--
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
Is it okay?
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
Can you help me?
Is that good?
I know, but--
<u>What's</u> your point.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
I saw a man die.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
Have you been working with Rachel?
Well, you know--
I've seen it.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
That's okay.
Is it over?
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
It's not?
Actually, that's not true.
And then what?
It tastes like fish.
When do I get to meet him?
Yes.
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
You being audited?
I can't.
You have to.
I've never met him?
Yeah?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
I don't under--
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
Do I know you?
Where've you been?
Did they take your clothes?
No.
Usually they take clothes.
What about jewelry?
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
They didn't take the silverware?
They only took electrical appliances.
Ssh!
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Rachel's dead?
Why would the NSA--
Listen to me.
You gotta--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Yeah?
Are you okay?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
You think there was a connection to--
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
There was a transfer.
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
We believe?
You're kidding me.
What's your ETA?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
I do not.
You should come into the shelter.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Do they know them?
Don't.
It's a folk song.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Would you let me pass?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
Dance with me.
Why did he bring you?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Shall we be all right?
A broken car?
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
Have you seen Katharine?
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Fhrer!  Il Duce.
Good morning!
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Which we've overflown twice.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
Is this you?
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Where did you find that?
Have a drink.
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Apprentices.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Could I have a cigarette?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
He's Canadian.
He needn't disturb you.
Yes?
Well then - yes.  Of course.
Really?  That's sudden.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
Hey! -
I'm still here.
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
I'm not sewing anything else.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
Of course.  When?
It's what I've learned.
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
He's sleeping.
Darling, Peter says I could stay
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
Kip?
This was your garden?
Through a window.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Don't overestimate yourself.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
I didn't expect you to be so...
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
I know.
Give him the card.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
What the hell was that?
Those are my clothes.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
I go in alone.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
Our equipment has arrived.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
We did it.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
Well...What are we doing?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
The eight billion. From them to us.
What's that?
A parting gift from the Empire.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
There's always a surprise.
Pulse detectors.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
Jesus.
Come on.
No way.
Hang on.
I cannot get rid of you.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
--You're a cop.
You gave them the eight billion.
Which is--
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
You know where my loyalties lie.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Tony Marvin.
All of 'em?
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
How does someone get meningitis?
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
The what?
Any school you want.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
I'm sorry, Erin.
So what made you think it was?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
Course I did.
I don't get why they'd do that.
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
I like this case.
Really?  It makes me sick.
What?  Who?
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Counts?
Not in my world.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
How dare you take that away from me.
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Here what comes?
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Whose number do you need?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
You got a little girl?
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Thanks for reminding me.
You're not nothing, Erin.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
Uh-huh?
My lord.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
Much anger in him, like in his father.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
I have felt it.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
What are you so grouchy about?
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
We?
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
There's something out there!
No lightspeed?
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
How's your mining operation going?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
You don't have to do this to impress me.
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
I have followed my feelings.
That they are.
But I feel The Force flowing!
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
But we saw Earth destroyed.
Zira, are you mad?
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Go easy, Stevie.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
I tried...
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Defense against what?
So what does this thing do?
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
How do we get out of here?
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
You're running out of time.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
When you threw it in, what did you see?
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
But not from your destiny.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Guenevere...
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
You, my lord.
I will run.
A lovestruck page!
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
Now you must pay me.
I?
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Here.
Oh, I see.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Never.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
Did he tell you about my party?
No.
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Could you see her?
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Hey, where'd this come from?
Where?
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Captain Howdy.
Oh I bet he is.
Regan, why are you reading that?
I wouldn't talk.
Yeah
You like him.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
How do you know?
All done.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
Damien Karras.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
I stole it.
What's playing.
Who's in it?
I'm not Regan.
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
Did you do that?
Do it again.
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
No momma.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
What is it?
Only what I read in the papers.
Yeah, a fall.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Is that a threat?
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Yes?
Yes
Are you a relative?
Yes.
Twelve.
It's my goddamn car!
We have some lotion.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
What's the gig?
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
I hate your kids, Frank.
You're their uncle.
It was an accident.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
We gotta go, Jack.
I don't gotta go.
Jack.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
I'm not unhappy.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
What?
She'll get here.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
So what do you think?
Day.  Wednesday.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
What are you talking about?
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
How come I didn't hear anything?
A useless talent.
What?
Be reasonable, Jack.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
Jack, you're on television.
Jack!
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Yeah?
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
You sure?
Sick?  How sick?
So she's got a few sniffles.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
This is where the auditions were.
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
What-?
Where's your dress?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
What's wrong with it?
Nine?
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
I said I was sorry.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
Maybe it's legit.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
They must've bought the same map we did.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
What's with you two?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
The name's Baker --
Fucking.
Forget it.
Forget it.
Aren't the kids asleep?
How's egghead?
Nothing.
You were good.
Soap convention.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
Yeah... No.
Look, if you want to leave...
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
You don't pick your brother.
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
Is that what you used to do?
What are they?
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
How old is he?
And this thing can grow it?
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
That's not the worst part.
So you had a nightmare.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
One last time.  It's important ...
Is someone there?
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
Not anymore.
What are you going to do!
Jamie ...
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
What do you know about it?
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
... That's great.
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
So you left her?  Just like that?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
You have kids, Jack?
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
Were almost done here...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Where do I go now?
Damn...
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Yes you do...
Like I said, it's a business deal...
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
Me?
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
It would help me if we were.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Because thats where I live.
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
Youre kidding me...
Surprise.  Were pregnant...  Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
Jack.
I found it at an outlet store.  I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Its very human.
So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
This place is a perk, Kate.
A perk for what?
This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
Dont do that...
Promise me again...
Kate...
I'm sorry...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
You cant go!
Mrs. Peterson.
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Last night was great...
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
You look like an eighties rock band.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
You're on fire!
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
They're ready for you, sir.
Then what is it?
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
<u>Ben</u> did this?
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
But I'm not done with the machine --
Yes, thanks.
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
The Other Side got to him.
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
Just one, General...
He's making a fine recovery.
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
Doctor, what's wrong?
What's that?
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
Doctor, we've just about had it.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Sort of.
That's it...
Where's my daughter?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
...Is this a fucking joke?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
I did.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Clear him off the road.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
GOT IT?
Any others?
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
White Bear Lake?
Just a general way.
Mm.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
You know what a disparity is?
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
What... What is it all about?
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
...If it's so damned important to ya!
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Shep said 8:30.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
...Dad?
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
...There's a million dollars here!
Well, that's okay, I just -
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Yah?
...Geez.
Yah, that's a good one.
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
His wife?
Linda.
So... they didn't...
- looking.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
...So?
And his wife?
He's at Norstar.
Well -
What... ?
There's no one else here.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
No.  I found something new.
You need to make these your primary "action items."
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
Dynamite?
What does that mean?
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
Should we?
How did you find me?
I found a new one.
It's for men.
Like testicular cancer?
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
I don't know ...
Please.
Where?  Here?
Feel anything?
You... don't have to... leave.
When?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
Hello?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Would that be a problem?
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
But a good strange.
What are you reading?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
You get rid of her.
What is this place?
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
What... ?
Homework assignment.
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
What the hell ... ?!
... is over.
You're too young.  Sorry.
"Too young?"
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You have jobs.
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
I'm doing this for us.
What are you doing?
Appreciate something.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
Yes, it is.
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Why?
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
No!  It can't be.
Should we knock?
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
I'm not sure I understand.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Stop it, don't move him!
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Shouldn't we pull over?
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Can I ask you a question?
And you're gonna die after me, right?
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
Right. April 25th.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Stop the car!
You know what to do.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
"Next?"
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
You guys are real... aren't you?
No.
Show me how it operates.
You okay?
I've seen worse places.
No cigarettes.
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
Gawd, you look awful.
You comin'?
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
What's the job?
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
We just take pictures?
About 22 hours on site.
I know...
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
This your stuff?
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Most men are.
I was attacked.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
He's not a moron.
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
What are you two up to?
Can I help you?
I was nine in the sixties.
Oh, Lydia!
Lydia.  Lydia what?
Where -- ?
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
Parry.
Parry... I'm Jack.
I'm not married.
Can I take you to lunch?
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
So what? You going to help me?
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
It's such a great song.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
Beautiful night huh?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
Parry Parry?
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
You're not going to play it again.
You said.
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
I'm going on over there...
I know you're not.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
Rayette.
Alaska.
No substitutions.
Now don't...
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Robert...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Why?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
Thank you.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
You had no inner feeling?
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I don't find your language that charming.
Is he?
Robert?
Four or five years.
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
Robert, do you mind?
What?
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
Oh, for chrissakes...
What kind of doggy is that?
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
What?
Why you have an attitude for?
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Wussup?
So watcha doin'?
Nothin'.
What are you doin' here?
Of course.
I buy them flowers.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Wussup?
Which one?
Yo! What you goin' for
How does he look up close?
Wha'?
You sure?
How do I know you're not lying.
Not really.
Where you know Amanda from?
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
That's what he said.
Sonofabitch.
Creasy, how old are you?
Fletch, this is dumb.
Fletch!
What? What are you talking about?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Fletch F. Fletch
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
We play tennis at the club.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
What?
I'm fine.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Harry S. Truman?
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
I know.
Sure you did.
Why not?
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
You sure got the hard part.
'Magic' today, huh?
Thanks.
Did you say cops?
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
She's cute as a button.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Preoccupied with what?
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
You were in the war?
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
How do you know about that?
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
I think you better sit down.
What is this....
I checked. There was no divorce.
You shouldn't be here.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Where is she?
Moved out.
She moved out.
So you're saying she moved out.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
I never read the paper.
You broke it? You know the source?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
Get out of here.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
But I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
So many assholes, so few bullets.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
All your friends call you Jazz.
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
So what about this watch?
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
You going to be okay?
How'd you get this from her?
Yeah, let's bury her.
Hello, Ford...
I came to warn you...
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Ford, you were right!
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
I'm sorry...
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Polo.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
The point?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
That's cute.  You're funny.
Mr. Doyle.
Who knows?
What's your name, asshole?
It has to be by the end of this week.
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Drink this.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
Popeye.
What about Sal?
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
You okay, man?
How was your tour?
Butch called.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
I swear, Satch.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Wait...
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What?
Oh my god.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
What?
I never knew you, Dad.
When?
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Are you alright"?
Something happened, something...
When?
What are you talking about?
I'll warn them.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
I'll be damned.
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
In my pocket.
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
Huh.
You're all just jealous.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
What're you doin'?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
Are they following us?
Bullseye!
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
Oh, jeez.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
But, Dad, we...
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
So what are ya drawin'?
Wait a minute. I just...
Nancy.
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Where'd you get this?
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
Which is?
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
Will you listen, dammit!
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Eight times.
Well, let's hope not!
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
I need to talk to you.
Okay.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
For a good reason.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
I mean really never.
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
A major prick.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
Right.
Did you hear that?
What's that?
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
What are you talking about?
What a beautiful day.
You pushed me...
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
I can't swim.
What is your location?
I heard you weren't coming.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
Big mess every time.
We must abandon.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Alla puttanesca.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
Don't talk like that.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
We must abandon.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
And he was there?
That's awful.
Do we care?
Do not inhale.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
What?
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Great game.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
What will we talk about?
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Two-all after six.
That's always been my problem.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
Since when did that matter?
My back is killing me.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
What do you want me to do?
Matthew's my grandson.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
I hate the Mets.
How come?
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Mine was cobalt blue.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
I think I remember.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
He wears a disguise.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
Enough.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
It was one incident.
What do you want?
You will respect the law.
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
Perhaps some tea?
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
Something's not right.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
I have to know where you come from.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
A day or so.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
We can't stay here.
Where?
In a corridor.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
Why have you done this?
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
I hope he's not just a body.
They found an eyelash.
What <i>is</i> this place?
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
I've got enough here.
I'm not doing it.
What about your wife?
We'll try again.
What's Beynon got set up?
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
How does it taste?
I guess I'm kind of...
I'll be okay.
I was going to fix you breakfast.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
At least you were outside.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
They checked in.
Why?
There are three men dead.
He might be ready to chop us up.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
How long ago.
Are you hungry?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Sounds good.
You want to try with me?
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
What's wrong?
How long before this car's hot?
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
Chicago.
Yeah. I got out.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Aren't we going a little hard?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Then you do it.
Just fine.
And I keep my mouth shut?
How long have you been married?
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
What's the damage?
I got a nurse in mind.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
What did you do?  Albert?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
What's it got to do with you?
Well, he drove it into the river.
What about?
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Christ, what...
No, don't Jack, don't.
Address?
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
Really?
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
No. I didn't know that.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Entertaining.
That's why you waited for me.
Not entirely. No.
Expect so.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
What?
Did you work with him, Keith?
It just would. He was always the same.
Since when did he drink whisky?
What happened to you, then?
What is it?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
You don't look it.
You sod.
What about Keith?
So shut up.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
You coming back?
Jack Carter.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Jack! I didn't like that.
Eh? Have a drink.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
Not suede boots!
What's that? A hundred?
...they hold on to their money...
To get on the...
...this shit...
It's too...
I, I...I...
And it's not right to the customers.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
For some sales pro...
Nurses.
He is?
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
You don't ax your sales force.
They...
Huh.
Yes.
We're just "talking" about it.
Well.  Well...
Did you?
You're going to steal the leads?
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
He'd give me a job.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
What?
What?  What?  The leads.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
Yes.
Why would I do it?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
I, you know, they should be insured.
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
The cops?
Go to lunch, George.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Excuse me, sir...
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
Murray...
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
...let me...are you listening to me...?
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Murray said...
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
And what if you don't close.
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
You're so full of shit.
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Because I don't like you.
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Home...
Oh!  For the magazine...
Twelve-fifteen.
Kenilworth.
Ricky, I...
What do I...?
I've got to talk to you...
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
When did you write the check?
She told me I have to.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Fuck the Machine.
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
We haven't got a lead...
Why not?
I'm going home.
Have a good trip.
Yes.
It went down.  I filed it.
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
I got lots of presents.
Did you see my present for you?
On your pillow.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
Yes, thank you.
Bought at the airport.
Then why do you come to me?
Because I need MONEY!
No.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
No.  I mean, are you sure?
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
You're going to talk to him now.
Yes.
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
Mikey, I hoped...
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
Wait... there's something else.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
That plane goes to Miami...
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Fifteen percent skim?
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Yes.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
The baby I lost...
Where can we talk?
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
We do favors for each other...
Nothing is more important.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
I just left our friend in Miami.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
I thought we would meet alone.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
What if I say shove it?
We got no choice.
How much more a month?
Just thinking out loud.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
I'm not married.
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
Well...no, not really --
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
But why?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
I don't like to talk about that.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
But we have to match the other sketch.
Ah.  A philosopher.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
You first.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
Not fear.  More like disgust.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
I suppose you'd like the top down.
If that's okay?
Is that really her?
Run for what?
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
I never made it to Korea.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
You okay?
Oh Clayton.
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
Hey, Boone.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
You didn't, Jimmy.
You only embarrass yourself.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
This is the studio where I paint.
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Quite.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
Jesus ...
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
Yeah -- ?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
I'm just here about my brother.
Get out of here, Ray --
How's that?
You'll leave -- ?
You have my word...
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
Consider me gone, Detective --
What for?
Where you been, anyway?
How are we supposed to--
You, too, Ma...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
Kip -- ?
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
Hey, now -
You hear me?
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
Price of doing business...
Nah.
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Shit ...
You know of one -- ?
Call 911 -
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
What kind of trouble -- ?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
Very good...
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
So, you seeing anybody?
I think so... They're just... So ...
You remember Junie?
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
Uh ... Randall -- ?
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Tell him. It's okay.
No. No. The guy from downtown.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
What do you do?
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Jezuz Christ!
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
There are cops all over the place.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
You know what to do?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
I gotta go home.
Are you okay? What happened?
What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
Who'd you call?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
It's a way outta here.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
You and Morgan throw?
How you doin'?
I told you, I just got change.
Did she get my Double Burger?
Did your Uncle get arrested?
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
I don't think I...Larry?
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
Seven.
Where is it touching you?
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
Hey, how you doin'?
Uh-oh.
Good to see you.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Would you excuse us?
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
I live right around the corner.
Seems like it's going well.
Jobs doing what?
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
--And confuse him--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
I don't know. India maybe.
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
What should I do?
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
You're right. I know.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
I might understand that.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Well, I can see this is pointless...
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Yeah. Do you paint?
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Watch your mouth.
Fine.
Well, are you going out again?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
They could see that I meant it.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
What?
You want to read it?
I know.
It's not your fault.
Good for you. Congratulations.
What?
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
No.
You grew up around here?
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
Promise?
I'm supposed to understand this.
Why do we always stay here?
I've never seen your place.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
It's important that I learn this.
Just for fun?
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why not?
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
I'm not honest?
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Naw. They paroled me.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
Joad.
How many men?
Women?
Two.
Why, I guess so.
Anything like work aroun' here?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
Been out travelin' around?
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
I ain't gonna run.
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
Women is always tar'd.
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
Want to work, do you?
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
This here's a strike.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
Got any plants?
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Anybody ask anything?
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Pa! Shh!
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
When?
Since before they stopped us las' night.
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
You promised, Tommy.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
How you get all this money?
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
We can pick anything.
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Yes I do.
What do you do?
You do not.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Bad experiences.
What's that?
Yes.
Unbelievable.
...Let me get my coat.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
He was trying to kill you, right!
That's probably a good idea.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Do you like the people you work with?
Okay.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Hello, Bob.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
One cannot love and kill.
Did you see Blank in there?
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
I bought a new rug.
Jim?
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
Of course you will.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Yeah...
He sells BMW's?
I have to get my head back into my work.
How are you? How's business?
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
He's beautiful.
The answer's no.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Five years. My son was born here.
Ever think of moving there full time?
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Oh, honey... What happened?
Is that your version of a pep talk?
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Fine!
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
I don't believe this!
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
You already did.
You got everything you need?
I'll come.
I'll take care of it.
Nothing.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
I should go get some of her things.
No, let me go.
Okay.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
May I have a suggestion?
Where to?
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
I'll help you with the coffee.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
I'd love to go there one time...
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
I understand, but Annie, please...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Mixed salad.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
I can't...
"... and I said that"...
Hey, darlin'.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Oh yeah? What's that?
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Ta-da!
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Up all night again, huh?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
What's this one eat?
Yes!
It has a killer refresh rate.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Uh, hold on...
You what?
I'll make it up to you!
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
So what are we supposed to do?
We need to talk.
This morning.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Not without Jamie.
Brady!
Get up there Rachel!
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Mom, please
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
What the hell did this?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Sure it does.
Coming.
I thought you said you were ready.
I can't.
We'll hear sirens soon.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Why?
That's all the windows, Dad.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
Don't you mean what you do best?
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Right here, Ben.
You look sharp. You understand?
This is 132, over.
I am. Ben Meeker.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
Sort of.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Okay.
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
Jamie! Get away!
You blame everything on kids.
You're going to be late!
It's been totally charted.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
What's the pumpkin for?
What's this big, big news?
Is that all you say?
Go get me a beer.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Promise?
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
A man wouldn't do that...
You have the wrong feeling.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Are you coming over tonight?
Can we watch the monster movies?
I saw him...
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
She's washing her clothes.
I couldn't if I tried.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Yeah.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
You're joking.
And you, you-you're going?
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Hmm?
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
You--  Standards and Practices?
Like, uh...?
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Yes, I do.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
How's everything?
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh.
What are you doing?!
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Is something wrong?
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Are you sure?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
I'm sorry.
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh, Jesus!
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
I think they're fantastic.
You look so beautiful.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
How is everything?
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Oh!
Gee.
Well, what about artificial insemination?
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Ohh?
Don't you think she does?
Ouch!
Well, how about this?
He's married...
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
How?
You're too demanding.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
No!
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
I recall you.
I'd never do that.
I'm okay.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Well...
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
Oh.  Oh.
Oh, I'm fine.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Thanks.
Mmm, what?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Uh-huh.
...I was <u>working</u>...
I have not read you your rights.
I hereby acknowledge that...
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
I'm looking for...
Then who's buying it?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
M'I gonna see you tonight?
I know her by the Back.
What, What, I can't hear you...
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
...are they hard to get?
First things first.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
I like Popcorn...
I won't take much of his time.
What would <u>that</u> be?
Exactly.
...young boys, still...?
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
You seen John Brigham...?
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
I don't <u>think</u> so...
You nervous...?
I'm an orphan.
What'd you say, hon...?
Give it up, Evelda.
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
You know it?
...should love to correct your error. 
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
If your duty requires it.
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
How could you know?
...Franklin.
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
You were given backup....
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
...what...?
Give me your gun...
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
Because...?
Ask me when we get home.
...what did you want? 
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
What shape is the scar?
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
Then what brings you back?
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
What is your point?
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
Because?
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
What are you gonna do about it?
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...

Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language.

I'll think about it.

You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
No.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
I don't really like your friends either.
Killing her won't solve anything.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Like a suicide thing?
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."

My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Do you take German?
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
Oh.
You must have had fun.

Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.

Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Of course, yes.
The way you just looked at me...
Eighty third most common.
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Hello I'm Dr...
I've been in here before.
Good boy.  Where's is it?
Oh my God. It's coming out.
Never to put you in my will.
Really, why's that?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Are you ready?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?

He gives a good report and I walk?
It's November.

My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
You were... very... inspiring.
Gale...
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
What's the matter?
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
Upset!  What's he upset about?
Said he's not an actor.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
What?
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
Who?
So where are all your toys?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
I'm looking for some perfume.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
-- a sense of proportion.
Who doesn't?
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Well, can I make an appointment?
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
Do you have a family?
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
I found a cent!
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
A man?  Was it a dream?
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
You could have a pool to cool off in.
We're going to think about it.
What?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
I thought we'd be happy here.
He wants to see me!
Philip!  The senior partner?
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
How large is your brood?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
Where have you been for the last seven years?
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
How long is the voyage?
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
It will be a good harvest this year.
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Different places.
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
No.
Good evening.
It will end tonight.
He's in there!
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
No.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
I love you, Conner.
What are you doing?
Talley.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
Jen?  Are you all right?
The car.  All you want is the car?
Bullshit!
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
There is no way out.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
What about my father?
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
You have his address?
What do you mean?
How did you get this number?
What do you want?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
Where is it?
Can we talk some more when you get here?
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
You gotta pee?
What are we going to do about Mike?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
She didn't answer.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
How about you and your sister?
We're okay.
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
What do you want me to do?
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
What happened?
Please, I don't use guns.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
What's happening?
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
What did they say?
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
You said you had no whiskey.
Where are my supplies?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
No, sir.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Business is good at the hotel?
Very good.
Satellite feed.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Very soon.
Perfect timing.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Our cards, please.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
He wants your wisdom.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
The president has been murdered.
This won't do.
How can we help him.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
I have a confession. When we met...
What's wrong?
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
That is why they call it coach?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
What do we do with all these people?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
Oh dear.
More the merrier.
Excuse me?
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
If you know where it is, get there!
Pritchett!
Prove it.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
Good point.
Cheery looking bunch.
This is the best we're gonna do.
What?
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Then who are they?
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
Question answered.
What?
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Rewind that.
Then who did??
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
But the million bucks each, that's for real?
Oh, no.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
It will heal.
By killing them?
She's down...
We're going to go someplace new.
She's down.  Help her...
Don't be afraid!
You didn't think much about that before.
What the hell is that?
Who?
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Should I...
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
Your daughter's been taken.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
You must be the new tenants.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Hello?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Something bad.
What will he do?  What does he want?
Uh-huh?
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Sorry.
What?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
I'll do it!
And he still sits there?
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Terri?
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
No.  We want ...
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
I'm sorry.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
You got about five minutes and change.
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
A little petting is not the issue!
That's what you theenk.
Prison?
The C.I. what?  God, no...
Where did you get this?
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
Good job, not pretty, but good.
No, let me!
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
Employer?  The president?
The Hoopsucker!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Well, maybe I --
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Sid found me the icepack.
...I'm sorry.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
...You son of a --
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
As a three-dollar bill.
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
Nah, that's all forgotten.
But, Buzz --
Geez, I --
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yeah?
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Hello, Niagara.
Maybe he's wise.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
Mrs. Rand...
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
You're single?
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
A mental case?
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
In other words, I'm on trial.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
So maybe you'll come too?
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
You want to go?
What do you think?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
Yeah, that one.
It's a starting place.
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Good.
Anyone special? You know...
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
Ben--
Huh?
A prior engagement overcame me.
What?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
-- What advice? You never --
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Thank you Janey.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
I saw you on your bike today.
You're not a psycho!
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
Social work?
Educated guess.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
Shit. You're not planning --
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
The Idiot?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
My what?
I do.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
You get in trouble?
Hey Wendy.
Just thought I'd stop by.
It feels warm.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
I had him!
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
Who's that?
Yeah.  All over.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
I don't remember.
Sorry about...
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
Eight years.
Looks like the natives are restless.
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
Fred Duggar?
Will.
Huh?
Ran like hell to go to him...
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
That's a long time.
It was like some big fucking secret!
But you wanted to.
Surely you know the one who made you...
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
You said there were none.
I can't save her.
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
You didn't even warm them, did you?
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Claudia - don't -
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
Don't mock, Claudia...
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
Never.
Yes...
Then my luck would have changed.
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You really want to be with them?
You're sure?
The crucifix -
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
What are you saying?
It's only a siren...
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
Yes...
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
What are you doing in my closet?
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
You're okay. Thank god.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Deep breaths --
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Hello?
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Cool.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
Must have missed the sign.
Drunk again?
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk 	he staggered.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
What is it -- what are you talking about?
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Theodosia.
Do you mind if I go with you?
I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
Come - you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Get that ladder up here.
Merry Christmas.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Yeah, very funny.
I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
By letting me help you.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
You have no car.
No, of course not.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Thanks.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
There it is, good as new.
What?
Will you try to get some sleep?
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Oh, George!
Anything I can do back here?
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
He's pretty young for that job.
Well, no younger than I was.
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.
Got a match?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Yes, sir.
Well, what about all your other friends?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Uh-huh.
You may kiss my hand.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Have you made up your mind?
Tuesday.
Do you like it?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
You can?
For me...?
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Your dad must be really pissed.
We're carrying weight.
Coming up!  Give way!
I thought you said she was going with us?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
Chief....
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
There is nothing to discuss.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Late.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Door's locked.
Nothing.
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
I know what you're going to say.
That's great.
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Bullshit.
Did you say Cable Junction?
When?
Dad!  Dad!
Is that me?
Mike!  Are you going out?
Whoops, almost lost one.  Can't play with the dolphins without skis....
Get a dance yet?
Shut up.
Nope.
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
It'll be fun, come on!
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
You're going out.
Michael....
I think we got a couple of live ones.
Brody's riding his tower.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
So?  So?
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
Sure am.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
My imagination isn't that good.
I don't like what he does.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
They're coming with us?
No.
That we swim.
And leave me down here???
Are you coming...?
You all right?
Yes.
I know I can capture it.
Here.
No.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
Finally.
They said you'd be here.
It's too soon to move him.
Michael, take deep breaths.
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
Are you okay?
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
I can have them walk backwards.
No, no.  That won't do.
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
I will.
We're taking that shark alive!
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
Thanks for helping.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Now what's this do?
The space shuttle has landed!
What're you doing later?
I don't talk that way.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Calvin said it was all right.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
Gee, it's good to see you!
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
You'll spoil her.
Can I make sandwiches...?
Yes, I did.
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Where have you been...?
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
All he did was kiss me....
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
Stop that....
That....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
He heard that.
I like Grandma's cooking....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
I'll be in to read you a story.
Nothing out of the ordinary....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
I have to get this finished.
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
No, you're not....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
That's hard to imagine....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
You sure you don't need glasses?
Want to go for a little ride?
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
Come on, Hoagie....
Inch by inch....
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
And it's always worked?
What she's got.  Nine knots....
How long have you known Hoagie?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
Shove it....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
You don't like my voice...?
Holy Christ....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
I'm training to....
Did you like that, Mama?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Only me and Mom ..
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
Yeah, he can go ...
How's the new residence?
Because I dislike her too much ..
Did he shut you down?
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
You looked like you did?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
What about Citrine?
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
Listen, you don't havta come?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
Have you got a match on the bullet?
Three or four.
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
Is this normal?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
Vehicle references.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
I know what a "witness" is.
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
Yes, Sir.
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
Did Amber have a dog?
Have you been here long?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
What are you reading?
No.
I know what you're like ..
I have to talk to you, Helena.
It's not possible right now.
Why does he want to kill me?
He doesn't need my help.
Yes, Sir.
Two or three years ago.
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
Shut up, King Jay ..
Ugh!
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
That's right.
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Listen to me!
Didn't hear it.
There is something missing here.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
No no...
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
It's all going to work.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
-- especially one like this.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Fine, I just --
What --
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
It's my fault.
He's coming over.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
That's the girl I love.
First you gotta tell me something.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
I'm sorry, I --
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
Why not --
Fine.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
How can I make your life better?
You gonna get that --
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
... dick?
One-two-three, swing.
No.
He should have kept his head tucked down.
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
You look good.
Nothing.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
You had the phone the whole time?
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
I CAN GET HIM!
Raptors, mostly.
Good luck with the fund raising.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
Know what this is?
We need to head for the coast.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Billy!
Sorry.  We were saying?
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
Hi, Dad.
Is that kid still bothering you?
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What is that?
Their what?
What are they?
Where's Kelly?
Head for the roof!
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
Are you sure?
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Oh, shit.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
The fences are electrified, right?
Dino droppings?
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
He sends his apologies.
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
These look kind of familiar.
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
Straight-A brainiac!
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
We gotta do something.
Ah - - they're here.
It's safe.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
I like cows.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
We miss you.
I hate trees!
Fifty.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Mister Biller?
You have a map.
What?
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
He's fucking nuts.
Doesnit sleep?
None of that's true?
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Great.	When can you do it?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
You're not going to be there?
You know how to use one of those?
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
And if he's not?
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
What happened? Where's Jason?
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
-- Merely in the interests of order.
Did you?
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
-- You appreciate my writing.
What an extraordinary request!
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
You're just doing your job.
It's what I'm paid to do.
Well, I --
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
I know.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
I -- I found your jailer.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
That's <u>mad</u>.
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
-- You seem amused.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
I could always apply there.
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
Women are all you have on your mind!
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
Ann ... Ann!
It must have been terrifying?
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Mm.
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
Don't belong?
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
-- We can talk --
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
Yes.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
What about?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
How would I remember?
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
-- OK?
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
How can you do it to yourself?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
Please.
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
What?
You and I -- a relationship.
Where'd you spend last night?
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Where, how?
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
You were hired to look for Tom.
Have you discussed this with them?
I've just got a few --
Two years ago? Sorry.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
Not unusual.
No.
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Mr. Kramer?
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Okay...Same as usual...
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Uh huh...
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
I don't think so.
Yep.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Why does he decide?
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Objection!
Yes, your honor.
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Six years.
Yes.  Very much.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
So do I.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
I don't recall.
How long was that?
I was not a failure.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
What about Billy?
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
How's the new job?
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
I've seen him.
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Only can I still see him?
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
And?
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
And?
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
Oh, Christ!
Oh, no..
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
John?
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
What are you going to do?
I understand.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
California?
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
What?
Yes, Holiness.
Not the way to talk to people.
No.
Dalai Lama.
General Chiang.
I am afraid.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
I miss my brother.
I am him.
Tell me.
Ask whatever you will.
Britain?
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Good day.
Pretend.
You cannot.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
Yes.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Too young?
Much too young.
I might get a shot.
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
Cocktail?
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
At school they'd always say "go" first.
I never had sex with you!
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Oh my God.
What?
In Maine?
You okay?  Kelly?
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
Excuse me?
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Like little children.  You okay?
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
Hector!!
Get him onto shore.
You said nobody came in here!
He's done.  He's dying.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
They're coming right in.
Should I?
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
<u>You</u>?
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
You and Kevin.
Liar?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Why not?
"- every day."
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Who's the subject?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
You seem pretty sure of that.
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
I am, yes.
Maybe they'll catch up.
I have no doubt of it.
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
Your bleeding has stopped.
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
They all were.
The death of my father.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
I - ran away...
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
No. We just -
Later, listen, I'll -
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
You know I can't make that promise.
My God, you've grown up.
Can we rest soon?
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
Dark haired...
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
What did you say?
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
Yes, sir.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Sergeant Major!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Yes.
Yes.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
Doc eat already?
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
Jesus Christ...
No way...
I need more light on that, Four.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
What can we do?
Twenty minutes...
I know that.
Do it.
If he had his blinkers on--
How is he?
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
JD.
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
What are you doing?
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
Where?
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
And look what happened to that.
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
You will what?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
Hello, can I help you?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
You know how much it is, Nick.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
That's going on optimism.
Twelve.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
How's business?
September '97, that's all she wrote.
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
What's that for?
So?
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
Whole different story; isn't it?
You little pissant--
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
Hey, it's the General.
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
So they stayed in Florida?
They were in the Army. Like your father.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
Maybe.
You could take it--
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
Seems like we have another one every week.
That so?
I haven't been out here for a while.
Morning, Hollis.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Not if I can help it.
And my father?
People didn't complain?
Okay? He's not here?
No. Is he sick?
That was the night he disappeared?
Morning, Sheriff.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
He's all yours.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
People liked him.
He hates me.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Pilar--
We thought we were something, didn't we?
So what are we gonna do about this?
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
How 'bout you?
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
Mister D'Amour?
Take a look at this.
Maybe they're not tricks.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Thanks, Billy.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
What about death?
So tell me where Nix is buried.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
No.
I was so afraid.
What was that?
Good.  There.  Yes?
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Somebody killed him.
And this Butterfield guy--
You believe that?
What are you, my mother?
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
I don't think the dead much care.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Yes.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
D'Amour --
My God.
The Puritan?
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
They got here before us.
He's better off this way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
He did something with the ground.
Call me tomorrow.
A couple of weeks.
What?
And?
Yes.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
How long have you been married?
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
No, I was looking at you.
Oh.
No, yes, it does...
Yeah? But look at you.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
We established that we have no communication.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
It's for my daughter.
Do you ever see him?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
When are you leaving?
Why are you crying?
Yes?
Mr. Harris?
Lydia?
Hello?
Is this a bad time?
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Hello?
That's ok.
I don't know what to do.
Like popcorn?
Uh..thanks.
Oh no...
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
I'm still shaking.
What a...jerk!
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
He spoke to you?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Why are you doing this to me?
So...we won?
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
How many weeks are you honey/
You just call?
Peter Kelson?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
And also that...
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
Get up!!
You okay?
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
How much time do we have?
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
There weren't any voices.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Would you sign it for me?
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
Thanks for handling this.
Hi.
Need any help?
Whatever.
Okay.
So you're still breast-feeding?
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
That was nice.
Uh-huh.
What?
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
This brother from my college.
He's in college?
I don't know how to walk in heels.
You lost your head.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
What's that?
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
For how long?
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
Didn't know you cared so much.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
Yeah.
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
Fine, Quincy.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
She understands.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
I...can't.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
Few days ago.
Funny.  I never did.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
So you're gonna bitch up?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
At one in the morning?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
You scared me.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
I just told you.
Sorry.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
No need for braces, Donnie.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Oh, she's fine.
What do you want? Why are you here?
uh...uh...What is it?
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Did you hear what I said?
No.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
-- do you wanna cup?
Ok, ok. I'm back.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
You wanna go on a date with me?
Eight o'clock?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
You don't know how crazy I am.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
What?
Ready to go,go,go?
Cynthia?
What happend, what's going on?
-- Richard.
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
I was listening --
He's doing the interview with the lady --
What happend?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
Is it real love?
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
Stay that way.
You mind your own bussines.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
Do you wanna sit down?
I need to sit down.
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
You do?
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
Graduation?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
I'm gonna start rolling --
So boring, so useless --
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
Not really.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
What am I doing?
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
Where are you from originally?
Psychology major?
It's not your given name, right?
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
Are you asking me a question?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
I'm really sorry.
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
I AM CALM.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
No.  I said that.
Marcie.
You on any medication?
Been drinkin' today?
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
Yes.
Are you alright?
I don't think I want that.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
Will that help?
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
Yes.
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
...say it, Jimmy...
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Hello?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
I can't.
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
Linda --
What are you doing?
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
Be ready at two --
C'mon, man.
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
Yes.
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
Hi.
....Why does he do it...?
This happens....this is something that happens.
No, M'lady.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
It can.  I know the way.
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
The Prison of Belle Sur.
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
Three days??!!
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
What you're asking is impossible!
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Forgiveness.
It is also a place of burial.
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
One for all.  All for one.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
Betrothed?  I think not.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
Get out of my way.
Continue.
You dead yet?
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
Sire, I --
I... we are humble people...
Did you know... about Raoul?
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
What do you need?
You set to go -
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Find out for me.
Well don't you think that's odd?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Did you read today's paper?
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
No.  A witness.
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
I killed them.
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Oh man...what happened?
Both at the same bank...
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
Are you going to be alright?
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Where am I going?
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
In thirty-five minutes.
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
No other possibilities?
Tell me now.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
What's it narrow down to?
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
'Changes?'
There's no connection between the families.
Will?
How far away's the back-up?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
You'll come by?
It's me.
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Yes.
Do you see?
'No' what?
Not me.
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
Dr. Chilton.
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
She'll be in, in the morning...
No. I can help you.
Do you know something about that?
Most people are.
'Intimate? !"
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
What did he want?
He asked how you are.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
What will you do?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
What's this Mama shit?
Meet point's up ahead!
What do you want?
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
No.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
Pictures?
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
That's interesting.
I haven't decided yet.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
Pretty well.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
So who's gonna pay for it?
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
And all this will be for real?
Go away.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
You don't know the real me.
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
Then your father's a wimp.
Are you sure?
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
And you are?
Weird.
That's the third white van I've seen.
What?!
You're two hours late.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
Sorry.
Dead.  All dead.
How?
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
How long?
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Morpheus...
Right now?
The agents --
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
What do you know?
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
This isn't real?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
And you still believe I'm the One?
Did you believe in them too?
Got it.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
I'm going to make the call.
I'm not the One.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
Who is?
Why?
Should I be?
That I would have to make a choice...
I'm coming with you.
No one has ever done anything like this.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
How?
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Which way?  Which way?
I'll be all right.
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
Well the guy over there said...
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
Why?
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
No.
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
That's not going to help.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
No.
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
You getting out too?
Oh Michael, look...
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
No, she's got epilepsy.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Did you?
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
A paper on that one too?
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
You know why...with my parents.
Don't count it...it's all there.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Well...no.
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
How much?
Can you spare it?
-- But he does seem very nice.
Look who's talking.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Have you got a minute?
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
Thank you for coming.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
'Yes'.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
No --
Sit down, Drew.
Whose?
Yours.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
That's it?
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Don' be facety, woman.
My Doctor Lady?
I am.
Rass!
Good morning, Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
What?
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
I didn't know that.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
How did you meet?
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
'Big'?
I've got plenty of friends.
Joe --
I came to see you.
Very well, I'll watch.
Whatever you do.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
Excuse me?
...No.
What will we do?
It's a saying.
-- Yes?
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
It is a deal?
A 'deal'?
What do you mean?
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Why didn't you stop me?
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
I'm her father!
'Spooning'?
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Death!
You should hope quite a while.
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
What the hell are you talking about?
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
Does Drew tell you everything?
You're only six-five once.
Don't get dirty, Dad --
Daddy, what's the matter?
I don't know, I can't say --
Nothing lasts.
I've got to go --
30.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
So you're holding my calls?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
What the fuck are you doing here?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
Is that what your little note says?
Have I told you what this man did?				*
Yes.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Did you?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
I told him about your car.
What does he want?
I'm not.
A BEER, please.
What are you here for?
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
I'm not appealing the decision.
You've read it a hundred times.
What the hell you want to go there for?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Teddy. Your buddy.
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
What's wrong?
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
And...?
"And" what?
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
What do you think?
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
Make it 40%.
Okay.
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
What do you like to drink?
Where's that?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
When?
Would you find me...?
If they attack you...
Packaging?
And there's Dmitri...
Alonzo...
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
Anything?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
Chill out Sonny.
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
Go ahead.
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
How?
Out of...?
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
How will it stand up?
Yeah...?
On the phone.
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Not French registry?
So lay it out, my brother...
What do you care?
Then what were we talking to you for?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
You're hoping to get a look at what?
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Lotta rich women back there...
No, ma'am, I'm not.
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
What of?
Who?
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
You got that, shit face? Asina...
What?
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Those mountains? are they?
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Beats working.
That doesn't seem so bad.
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
We go back.
What?
Oh we... we...
What?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Why the suit?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Mr. Yesil.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Peter...
We'll be back at the platform in...
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
I pull.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
The scent won't last...
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
I know how that can be.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
You really think so?
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
Annie, what is it?
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Be my guest.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
They're hauling Misery into court.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
You won.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Well do you disagree with that?
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
Range is two kay.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
I wouldn't do that.
Hola..
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
And six billion in the world.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Yes?
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Have you met them?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
What did you think you were doing!
- you who don't have a conscience.
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
'Terrorists?'
Excuse me?
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
She must still be on the property.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
Do I?
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
And if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
I didn't say that.
We did what we had to do.
Claire...Hey...
This is Kittridge.
I dont think so.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
Yeah.  I follow you.
Yes.  I see your point.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
The arms dealer.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
It doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Bank?
IMF mainframe.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Jack.  Jack.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
Oh?  What's the problem?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Jack you're so wicked.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Such a nice ass.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
What?
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
Rose, pass the wine.
You don't have to help me.
How'd he die?
Fast.
Instantaneous.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
How many men since then?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
You ruined my life.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
For what?
What's the matter?
I'm here!
You're late!
This is where we're going!
Let me go home.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
No?
Maybe you're right.
What?
What time is it?
Seven-thirty.
Alright. A month. In a month.
And who's gonna pay for that?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What the hell happened to you?
Everything's different.
No more he's not.
Hi.
What about the moon?
We just come from the bank.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
Don't fight.
He should pay.
Talk to him.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
Loretta...
May I presume to ask you a question?
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Why do men chase women?
I guess you can't invite me in?
No.
Rita. Rita.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc's in Palermo.
She's got it.
What do you mean?
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Oh!
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
Come on then.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Look!
You'll what ... ?
What is your name?
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
There!  Look!
What?
There are some who call me Tim?
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
What?
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
Be quiet!
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
Well?
My name is Sir Launcelot.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is your quest?
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
Herbert.
But, Father.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
We're coming with you.
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
What is your name, handsome knight?
Why?
No.  It's unhealthy.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
You've come to rescue me?
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
I can't move to tidy.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
I need a man who knows where I am.
Awaiting my orders.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
I am a blank sheet.
Dare say you can be taught.
Too busy looking after themselves.
No loyalty.
I am.
And the pony?
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Yes, ma'am.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
What?
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
I am told so.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
John?
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
I'm breaking no promises!
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
So?
What did he want?
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
I have no idea.
How do you stop The Screamer?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
But how can it change every time?
Dead?
Has anyone seen Greg?
Sick?
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
I came from the city on the left.
Hello?
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
So how did it know my name, then?
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Nick, what is it.
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
The Police, then...
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
Dante's Inferno.
What are you looking for?
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
Of course I am.
But I don't understand...
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
Adam, where are you?
Beautiful night.
I agree with what you said...truly.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
That's okay.
You're still here?
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Yes, there was.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
Mulholland Drive?
What's wrong with that?
"You're still here?"
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Betty Elms.
I had a dream about this place.
Oh boy.
You see what I mean...
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
You feel it?
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Find out who they are?
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Where at?
Making ends meet, huh.
Not here...no thanks.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Why should we trust you ?
How do we get out of this room ?
So what do we do ?
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
I wanted to let his family know....
What are you DOING here ?
Don't.
Don't eat at the console.
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
John, sir.
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
One moment dear... 
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
Bruce has just awaken.
We can't afford too many surprises.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
He was right behind me !
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
THANK YOU.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
Pommeroy.
You want me to move?
No nuns, got it.
Totally groovy huh?
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
How about a nice glass of milk?
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
Maybe he's wet?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
She's beautiful.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
Come on in!
What are you staring at?
Is it okay if I drink this?
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
He's writing. Hello?
Vada?
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
No THANKS!
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
And I thought I was weird.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
In the tar??
Where are you going???
And you'd be my cousin?
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
No problem.
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
This is it I guess.
You want me to come with?
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
You're Nick's mother?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Well maybe for you.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
Arthur!!
Vada!!
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
What do you mean??
Harry, I really think she.....
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
I wrote that.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
What happened to her?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Perfect.
She likes to play bingo.
Are they ready yet?
When?
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
No sweetheart, you can't.
Why not?
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Hi.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Thank you. Bye.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Why do you think she says that?
Is that your camper?
He's allergic to everything.
I would.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
How old are you?
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
Hurry!
No, I don't wanna.
Who's that with your Dad?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Don't DO that!!
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
What?
Jump in the water!!
I wanna live with them too.
I dunno..
Well when you get older, you just have to.
Okay, okay.
What?
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
We'll never be the same.
No, he's ruining yours.
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Elmer's Glue?
I did what I came to do.
Can you watch the road?
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
What else did he tell you...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
But he sure can kiss.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
Ju...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Exactly what?
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
Don't you see...
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
And she's all wrong for me!
She's too genuine.
Endearingly absent-minded.
Quite the little eccentric.
She finds him "personable."
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Dance card filled?
Where did we first hear th...
Will she like it?
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
Almost three.
Because I could come...
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
What is that sup...
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Right here.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
No.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Am I disturbing you?
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
She's fine.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Barbara Jean.
It's on National television, Barnett.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Howdy.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
How in the world did he get shot?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Uh huh.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
Nash.
Oh... Well.
I feel really good.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Yes.
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Who is this?  It's Tom.
Wow!
Stay.
I knew when I first met you.
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
You sound different. Is that really you?
Hello.
What National TV...?
Oh?
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
Naw, she don't mind.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
Who isn't?
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
No fuckin' way!
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
How 'bout Mallory?
Yeah, sure.
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Okay, boys, let's have it.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
It sure is.
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
What are we talking about?
Give her a beer.
Where' you goin'?
Want me to come?
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Walker and Williams.
What d'you want?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Where's he at?
Thanks.
Well, he worked around.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
No. I'm new in town.
That's right.
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
How about another beer?
What d'you mean?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
That's the way he is.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
That's right.
What's he like?
Thank you.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Well, what d'you think?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
How come you keep askin'?
What the hell could you do?
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
What d'you mean?
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Wouldn't have known you.
No, thanks.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I guess not.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
No. Why?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
Take this off.
Ghost a steppin' razor...
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
She's ready to go.
All things possible in Babylon.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Where the hell have you been?
How much time you got left?
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
Want to fucking answer them?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
Case... are you okay?
I had to limit your options.
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
Won't that mean you're dead?
You okay?
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
He projects with neural implants.
What is it?
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
How are you at riddles, Peter?
What?
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
It is?
Oh, man! Who told?
Leave.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Wow. It's packed.
Do I want to be crunched?
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
How many times have I fired her?
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
That's your story!
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
You having fun?
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
You're twenty-three years old!
Dorothy Parker--
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
You have to say that. You're my student.
I know.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Wait, I was going to tell you--
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
I don't know.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
Into our group.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
You ruined the whole thing!
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
Yes.
I know.
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
You got your room straightened out yet?
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
Come back here!
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
Who?
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Mom?
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
What's happening?
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
Nancy!
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
It's over.  It's over.
This is nice.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
Just until we get things under control.
Stop blaming yourself.
Take us there, Kristen.
We can try again.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
Who is he?
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
What are you talking about?
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
I'm in.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
No.
I forgot my bag.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Floppy, huh?
You abide by rules like that?
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
She left me.
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
Yup.
You have a stunt bottom?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
I don't know what happened.
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Yes...
Can I have your autograph?
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
The movie star?
Bella -- this is Anna.
In a depressingly asexual way.
What?
Da Vinci?
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
What do you think?  Good move?
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Mr. Thacker?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
You haven't slept with her, have you?
Definitely no comment.
Well?
Oh God no.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
What are the choices?
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Spike.
Yes.
Yes.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Yes.
What?
But you have no proof.
M-m-m-ma'am?
Y-y-y-yes...
Who? Tell me!
Yes, ma'am.
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
Sorry to have bothered you.
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
That's okay, kid...
O-o-o-oh...
So long suckers.
A bus?
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
Yeah, kid?
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
M-M-M-Mack?
Yeah...
Wait a minute...
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Let me get on your shoulders.
Where ya goin', Mac?
Yeah, where we going?
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Neither do I...
What for?
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Giving up?
He can't hear you!
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
It doesn't help him.
What for?
No!
Let me see your hand!
Gimme a cigarette!
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
Gimme the ball!
I wanna go home!
He's not!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Oh, what was that?
Poker!
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
In what way?
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
'Kay, Mac!
I'm the next one.
You think it's funny, huh?
Somebody's coming!
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Tha's your problem.
And you haven't heard the last of this!
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Your mother.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
So, what's the story with your friend?
No.
You're sure...
Let's find a telephone.
We found each other, didn't we?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
There is one other thing you should know about me.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Smoking or non-smoking?
Who's this?
He's safe.
Does he love you?
What?
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Right now?
Oh.  That's nice.
How about music?  You like classical?
Well.  Congratulations.
Yes.  I am.
There's no such thing.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I was hoping for the real thing.
Well, not exactly...
Yes?
Faith, this is my mother.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Kate, is something the matter?
Now what do we do?
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
So?
We're saved!
What's that supposed to mean?...
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
It was a ouija board, remember?
Peter found him?
What if he doesn't like me?
And he is living proof.
And you are?...
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Huh?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Right.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business?
Then don't.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
What the hell!!!
I could have been better!
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
I wish I knew, Edie, But 
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
Everybody knew him. He got around.
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
What?
I don't know.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Why, Terry, who said it was?
You don't believe in anything, do you?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
You haven't finished your beer.
What for?
What are you crying for?
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Get away from me.
Charley.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
A question of who rides who.
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you   Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
This is my business.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
Who asked him here?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
Boy, you must've been up early.
You ought to go home and take care of that
I'll bring him up to your loft.
So-so, Johnny.
Listen, Johnny
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
Keep Charley out of this.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
The ropes are coming loose.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
Well?
The moon is almost gone!
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Then cancel my order.
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
What're you talking about?
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
Oh, is this Adele?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
Till they got busted.
Ask him his name.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Just that she got away.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
Sure looks that way.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
Whatta you think?
Forty-five minutes.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
I'm going back inside.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Shut up.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
How are you, Raymond?
Quite a mess.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Hello?
How much for your company at chow?
I bet.  How much?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
Good luck, Richard.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
How many was that?
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Nothing.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
I can go to the bar.
I don't have a problem with it.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
You really wear that suit.
You believe that?
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
So she did help you?
You getting serious on me now?
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
Weren't you expecting us?
I hear six.
Thanks for your help.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Of course not.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I were you, I'd get up and run.
I'm not leaving Midge.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
The <u>ninth</u>?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Do we have a gun in the car?
And is Foley a part of this?
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
It's a --
I really gotta go.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
Not at all.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
You gonna go get him?
Out for the evening?
What?
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
You mean hiding them?
Red...Strange?
Yes Sir.
Sir, I --
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Yeah.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
It's Germans!
Good shooting, Danny!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
How come you're not pukin'?
Fuck you.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
Then wh-where do we land?
I heard what you did.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Thank you, 'Mam.
You take care, Dorie.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
We're all going away.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
What if the Japanese did invade?
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
Fook ya!
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Do you have to wear that hat?
Carol!
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
Refresh my memory.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
I'm sorry Charlie.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
Forget it, it'll never work.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
Oh, Charlie.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Hello, Charlie.
Yes, sir.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Don't you get along with your parents?
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
The hat business is in trouble.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Does everybody have to hear?
When did you start drinking coffee?
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
For what?
What does Charlie think about that?
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
You look exactly the same.
Okay. I promise.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
What's the matter?
Wait! I'll go with you!
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
I think so.
Hey! Where're you off to?
So where're we going?
Zowie...
Why not?
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
It's weird...
Are we interrupting, Andy?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
One hour!
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
Innocuous?
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
Sure. It's fine.
You survived your first gay party intact.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
Opera?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
Yes. On my torso.
What can I do?
Not unnecessary ones.
Yes.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
I'm fine.
Mom?
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
In what way?
Right.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
That's correct.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Probably since she was born.
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Okay, Joe...
Joe?
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
Tell me that was you.
Bring the light!
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
'Mean the whispers?
We can, can't we? Trust you?
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
You'd die for them?
What do my eyes see?
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
Not sure. Ten?
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
What, switch what?
Big Evil?
Well, don't ask me to.
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
60 years ago.
I never said I was.
For your own fear.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
I don't suppose....
And pointless.
New Mecca....
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
...then we saw this.
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Not a star-jumper.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
How did you know we'd come here?
Seal the cave?
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
What's so special about him?
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Got your sensors?
Yo!
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
Landon! Send a last signal.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Can we take a dip?
Who put them up?
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
With one of them.
What about me?
You lied. Where is your tribe?
I don't know.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Of course.
Sure.	In a cage.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
...but 'Lias is still out there.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
So what's the problem?
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
First time?
Dawn! That was it!
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
No, thanks...
Must be somebody?
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Whew! - where that come from?
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
Indefinitely?
I don't know.
I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
Bank?
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
Your liquor laws..
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
And do you amuse the guests?
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
You tried to run away.
Bad enough.
What time is it?
There's a lot of night left to live through.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Please answer my question.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
You were there when I last saw him.
I don't want to talk.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
Where?
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
Information.
That COULD BE TOLD.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
How would you know, Brandon?
A little something on account perhaps?
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
Send that?
You get it's brother.
Right.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
Was that about the right angle?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
You can find out.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
What about me?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
I am a fool.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
And if you didn't believe me?
That leaves two strangers.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
I don't know, sir.
Get out of here!
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
Attributed?
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
And some of that.  Sorry.
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
I think it went on rather too long.
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
How nice.
Jeremy phoned this morning
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
To the airlift.
Oh yes.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
Hold those rights.
Hello.
Have you come to talk about me?
All right.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
Dad.
That's good.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Oh no!
Don't point it at James!
We'll see what we can do.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Ever done this before?
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
You gotta earn trust.
Don't screw around man, pull it!
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
What?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
I know where they're going.
Catch of the day.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
You're looking well, Dutch.
There's something else, Major...
Georgia.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Please, we hardly know each other.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
What's that?
Nice car.  Yours?
Why?
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Off the boulevard.
Can I have some chips?
Where'd you go?
Mmm, I could tell.
I buy companies.
I'm not just talking about sex.
I got a dress, yeah.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
Television?
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Was someone rude to you?
Good.
You always been rich?
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Shush.  Of course you can.
I've never been on a plane before.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
You're being ridiculous.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Did I wake you?
I don't think there's any sense in --
Edward, we've been together ten years.
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
In Beverly Hills?
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
You sure you won't come with me?
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
Then you would use your--
Are you looking for something in particular?
What is with you?
Yeah.  Thanks.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
Every ship but the four you sent.
You're a silly girl.
He knows I do not love him.
And what am I?
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
I fear I'll never see you again.
Well ... you were dead.
I will never doubt again.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
We did it.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
It's you.
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Yes.
Yellin.
Sire.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
Who won? How did it end?
Yes.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
Why? You can't even lift one.
Where's Fezzik?
Sir. Sir.
Hah?
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Well, sir, it seems ...
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Yes, it's quite possible.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
I'm not going to jump on you!
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Right.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Like clockwork.
I shall count the minutes.
Of Siegfried...
The Blue Max...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
What?
Tell me all about her.
Back where?
What do you mean?
Someone is sitting in that window.
Now, look...!
No. I told you, she's confined...
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
She stole some money.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
I feel better when you feel better.
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
Why can't I go out there with you?
Well?
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
Watch your tenses.
Hospital clean.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
You can't go up there.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Can you?
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
You're very... kind.
Uncommon, too.
I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
Except you.
Why don't you go away?
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
I'm sorry.
Mary is Lila's sister?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
Arbogast.
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
I don't know what you've been saying.
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
No mother.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
What's down there?
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
You're losing your blood?
Yes!
There's no child here.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
So that's the way it is?
Thank you.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I am right! I know I'm right!
Let it go.
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
Almost certain.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
What does that prove?
Make it snappy, Colonel.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Cry-baby?
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
To lunch.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
Shall we unpack it?
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
We flopped the first time out.
What did it want?
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
I've been dreaming about this.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Don't mention it.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Am I hurting you?
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
But how would you find him?
Daddy, what's the matter?
The new girl is here.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
I think Daddy suspects.
There goes Mother.
Yeah.
What are they doing, Doll?
No, Mother, he's lying...
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
No, son, she is dead.
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
I think we both know her.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Is this ill right?
Well, it's Billy.
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Your baby?
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
Afraid of the hospital?
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
Rose, you don't have to.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
Now you know what to watch for...
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
What... ?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Lay off once, would you?
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Where you gonna be?
How you doing back there?
Bullshit.
It doesn't say that.
That's him alright.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
Nope.
You can't be serious.
It's our job.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Let's get this thing done.
This shit was Ming.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
I can't do it, Ben.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Where am I?
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
Yes, my Master.
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
I...
Lando, grab it!
What are you telling them?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Oh!
What do you remember?
If that is your destiny.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Uh huh.
What was that bang?
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
No, don't do that.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
"Sweet Transvestite"
Dealing
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
...I suppose.
Do you have a phone?
It's all right -- You're my guest.
What?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Yes.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
...What?
Don't say that.
Christ.
That so.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
You're hurtin', man!
Of wa?
No wine.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
You can forget about sparring, kid.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Ya still light seventy.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Mr. Balboa --
Hey --
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
...What?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
...No.
Here's the card?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
I got pain an' experience too.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
What kinda business?
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
He's takin' cheap shots.
Sure I like her.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
A tweeting bird?
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
Surprised?
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
No...
You shot Roger.
What's with the dip?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
So what do you want me to do?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Have you got the will?
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No, I don't.
What the hell are you doin'?
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Does this help?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
A Toon?  Noooo.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Young Romeo is it?
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
[Within] Juliet!
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
You were a soldier, were you?
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I better be getting that.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
Don't do it, Sam!
Do you have the material?
Bad company...
There's been a slight problem.
Bullshit!
Then where is it?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
I didn't expect that he would.
Is that right?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
Lovely, isn't it?
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
I'm going with you.
You know him?
It's my job.
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
What of it?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
Doing well.  This is?
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Don't spend it all in one place.
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
Call it in I guess.  Why?
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
At the expense of six people.
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
I've got one condition.
What are you gonna do?
I...I can't do that.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
He would have done it to us, right?
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
How long is it going to take?!
It's gonna be o.k.
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
We're not?  How do you figure that?
Oh Jesus...
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Shut up, Jesse.
How are ya?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Yeah?  So?
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
You're worth every last penny.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
What?
What are you getting at?
Don't you have to be here?
Have you known this all along?
I don't suppose you've seen her.
No, I can't say that I have.
What?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
This whole place?
Give me the bad news.
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
Yeah.
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
How'd you know?
Yeah, that's right.
No.  It's my first time.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
How you doin'?
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
Who died?
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
It sounds impossible --
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
You pull a muscle or something?
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
What?
Let me see it again?
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
No.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
End of the line.
Let's go.
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
What?!?!
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
A little Mu-shu.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Put your arms around me.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Did you tell Sterling?
The police can protect you.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Shut up!
You talk very fast.
You speak English!
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
I was being polite.
Witnesses.
I know a shortcut.
The license!  You get it?!
Did you make the plate?!
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
You like it?
What?!
What a surprise!
You're killin' me here.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
No...what?
I could get promoted right out of here.
Jesus...what do you want?
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
At this point we don't have much.
Yes.
Han?
Yes.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
What?
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Fisher, let him talk.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
Okay, we'll order out.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
I don't think that's why she ran.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
And you are?
Twice...
Too much.
You afraid to try?
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
It's fun!  It's high.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
Yes I do!
Does it matter?
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
You okay?  I'm closing.
No, I'm just going to head home.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
No.  It's my life.
A harmless joke.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
No.
He's got a houseboat.
I hate boats.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Nope.
Does it have wheat in it?
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
You go.
You couldn't.
It was my mother's.
So what happened?
You should write something about this.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
Men never get this movie.
Hello.
What?
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Yes, I did.
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
How amazing.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
What?
You know.
It's a sign.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Who is this?
It's not that late in Seattle.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
It is not --
Seventy... eight.
I don't know.  Do I?
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
So I can go.
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
-- a slice of pizza --
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Great.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Okay.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
No.
God, she's beautiful.
You said we could go to New York.
If I didn't go.
No.
Do you like it?
Hi.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
No thanks.
How's it going?
You want 'em all arrested?
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
No.
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...
That's it?
Did you see his hair color?
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Go ahead.
It's not that easy.
I can't leave.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
This has nothing to do with him.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
Why's that?
Sorry.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
You wanna score some go-fast?
Palmdale
You want a hit?
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
Why?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
Crank or glass?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
Can we talk price?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Anything for a dear friend.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Danny, I'm touched.
You think I'm a Judas?
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
What're your taking down?
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Jesus.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
When is the deal going down?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Just no pleasing you, is there?
Here it comes, poor Tom.
What is it, drugs?
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
In West Fork?
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
Y'all come back.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
It seemed appropriate.
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
You?  Leading a squad?
PUSH!
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
You think they'll be alright?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
I don't think so, Captain.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
What deal?
Here they come.
Don't do that again.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
We know.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
I hope you understand.
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Lloyd, give it up.
Lloyd.
Hang in there, man.
So, what's your point?
What does it say?
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Wait a minute.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Goodnight.
You're going.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Yeah?
Busy?
Goodbye.
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Nobody knew me before tonight.
So what's your job this summer?
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
I think you should wear that.
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Okay.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah?
I don't think I am.
You need to study?
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
No.
Did you talk to Corey?
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
Then don't do it.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I'm fine.
It's your castle, man.
The guy with the Datsun?
No.
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Yeah.
I love you man.
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
What -
It's not a charade, all this?
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
Yeah, what's that?
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
You took my workers.
Look -
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
Yes.
And killing.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
They've broken their pattern.
You're sure about this two person thing?
What is it?
Stop it...
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Cici. Who's this?
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
I live here.
What?
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Yeah.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
A twist ending if you will.
Hello, Dwight.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
Not good. How you doin?
What are we looking for?
Oh my God. How could it happen?
What do you mean?
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
I have rehearsal.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
..this week's TKE kegger...
Gale?
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
Do you work for her now?
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
To see your reaction.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Jesus Gale what happened?
Are you sure?
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Is that a threat, Detective?
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
What about me?
I'm sorry, this is too good!
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Stop following me.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
No.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
No I need to call you. Just you.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Dude. What are you doing here?
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
I thought she was dead.
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
Oh it did?
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
Oh Sidney...
Are you serious?
I called my dad.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
I think you have the wrong number.
I don't think so.
You're making popcorn?
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
To talk.
I'm getting scared.
You tricked me...
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Evening, ma'am.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
I like it. It's... sexy.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
Did you reach my Dad?
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
Yeah.
Afraid not.
What about the cellular phone bill?
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Jesus...
What? What?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
Just stay back.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
No you didn't.
...so call if you need me.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
So what's his reason?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
And what would be your motive?
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
Do you really think Billy did it?
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
Here he comes.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
No one yet.
It's a bucket of vomit.
Good.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
How did the fire fight end?
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
Sorry about that... I just...
Him?
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
This is a waste of time.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
Where's the victory?
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Oh, you want to stay now?
Slut.
Put your gun down!!
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
You should look into private schools.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Did the wife confess?
Crime of passion.
Did their son see it happen?
But Mose Harper said...
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
He cometh forth like a...
I say NO!
What in...?
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Keep talking.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
He just couldn't wait...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
I think maybe we oughta...
Nine...  Ten!
Stay out here.
How? She's even forgot her own language!
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
She's not a little girl any more.
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
Ellen, move aside...
Do you have a better idea?
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
What?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
Hello.  Can I help you?
Ellen Straub.
You didn't tell her!
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
WillWhere is Mercutio?
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Follow that boat!
Do you know that house?
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
How much?
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
No, your marriage bed.
A share of the profits.
Of course not!
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
By God, I wish I knew.
How will it?
Burbage says you have a play.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
I am not so well-born.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
I would not for the world!
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
You can bring them with a word.
I do not know how to undress a man.
Oh
Oh--no, no!
You never spoke so well of him.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
You flatter, my lord.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
Good morning, my lord!
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
He is dead?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
Serve.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I don't have time.
No.
He couldn't get his car started.
You know what I'm talking about.
But not quite.
I want to talk now.
I don't know.
You're sure? There's lots more.
I want to secure it.
Your friends.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
So I gathered.
About the mail --
Well?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Cameron.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
Know and love?
You're right.
David?
You want me to kick it open?
Now?
Unfeasible.
Be careful.
Sshh.
No, no, it's different.
It tastes different.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
We have to talk.
Oh, good.
And the money?
I'll wait there.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Yes, absolutely.
Just get on with it, Alex.
Is this what they always look like?
No.
No one. I promise.
What?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Exactly what I was --
But they sneer, don't they?
I'm not sure --
What happened to that guy?
What guy?
You must be Juliet.
Do you think you could answer that?
No.
For what?
You know about it?
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
Same as everyone else.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
You're in a good mood today, George.
Maybe... why do you ask?
Yes, but... I thought...
What?
Lester.
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
What?
She did?
I'll be back in a while.
Hi.
She what?
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Her?
Yeah.
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
No thanks.
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
Don't make conversation with me.
They are?
Yes, Buffums.
You're late, George.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Why not?
It was after you, baby. After you.
George... how about Felicia?
You know what I'm talking about.
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
Baby...
You did, I know you did.
George...
Look, either come in or stay out!
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
What are you looking at?
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
-- It's Malone's.
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- oh -- sweetheart...
Jackie Shawn.
-- yes, George.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
Hi, George.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
What?
What about me?
Maybe you don't even like children.
What!
Okay, baby. Okay...
Yeah, baby...
I want your feelings about it.
When I get off work.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Jill says nothing.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
How?
What? What? What? What? What?
-- yes.
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
Thank you.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
What, do you think I planned it?
Didn't they tell you?
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
No --
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
Steve?
Then you were talking to him.
Of course not.
I'll call you.
Fine.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
I thought you said things were great with George.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
Well, you know what I mean.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
Honey?
Well, there was this one time --
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
-- He reached up and tore them.
That's right.
Good for you.
-- yes, Jill.
Are you married?
We'll let you know tomorrow.
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
Chocolate.
I don't know.
What about Room 237?
No I ain't.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Shall we go into the living room?
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
A nigger!
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Well...
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
Sure, Uncle Al.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
What's the money for?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Where's Mom?
Went shopping. Why?
Jane... you don't have to do that.
You booger.
What's that?
What kind of noises?
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Sure.
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
Was it a prescription?
What the hell does that matter?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
What if I say no?
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT
Yes, Mary?
And you listen to that?
How are you doing.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
What?
You bastard!
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
Oh my! 
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
Jackpot!  Two buckets
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Soprano or alto?
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Hopeless I
JUST SING!
What?
You have to help me
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Are you leaving us?
Enough joking.
What? 
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
You sent for me?
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
You saved my life.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
He's a businessman.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Hail, Mary.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Then one day they find you.
You won't even tell us?
A nun?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
However, we can also pray for other things.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
Ice cream!
It's so beautiful...
She said they were from her old convent.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
Certainly not.
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
We must be a curious sight to him.
You need to sleep.
Bring him.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Stains of blood.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Hmm?  See them?
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
We are leaving.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
True enough.
All I saw was their lantern.
What now?  Where is she?
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
People have put their trust in you.
No, but... why do you ask that?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
Yes, actually.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
There was not much blood, was there?
What... what are you doing?
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
All right then.
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Can I help you?
Well, what did you want?
They was a boy. We made friends.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Leave.
I want to watch T.V.
I hate you!
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
What's all them books?
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
Childers.
How come?
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
You told me to come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Well, I hate him.
I like the way you talk.
Hey Karl, you off work?
All right then.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
A boy or girl?
A little ol' boy.
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
You will? For sure?
Can we play ever' Saturday?
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
Yes sir.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
I ain't got no boy.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
Yeah.
What brings you back?
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
He just got out of the state hospital.
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
I didn't mean that.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
How'd you get started?
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
What do you mean?
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Did you ever go back to see her?
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
Still, you can't just write her off.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
For keeps?
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
And why the hell would you give me money?
What does that mean?
How the hell did you get into the building?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Just passing through.
Hi there, little brother.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Yeah? Who is it?
Baby? And what baby is that?
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
I mean breakfast.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
Thanks, but I'll manage.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
What time is it?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Three nights.
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
I don't have much time. 
Why don't you go to the police?
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
And started to run.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
None.
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
What makes you think I play?
You wouldn't even see it move.
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Can I say something, here?
I can't speak for him.
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
Upsy-daisy.
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
A what?
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
We're not?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Hey, Joe!
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Nellie told us about it.
Where are we running, Joe?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
Down, Daphne!
What are you doing?
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
You can both go take a flying jump.
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
Joe -
Sugar?
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
Oh - Sugar!
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
And your head is hot.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Here you are, Sugar.
What do you think you're doing?
I guess she's not in here.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
Thirty-four.
I was it.
- you got to be blonde -
- and you got to be girls.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Bull fiddle.
This is where I get off.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
I forgive you.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Oh?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
We got it second-hand.
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Have you ever been with a male band?
You know - I play tenor sax.
Men!
About what?
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
What's happened?
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Want to switch berths with me?
Would you mind terribly?
Not very likely.
That must be it.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
Why?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
Where's your shell collection?
It's the crews' night off.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Have you tried?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
You mean you can't fall in love?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Is it that hopeless?
What is it?
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Good morning.
Did you have a nice time?
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Daphne -
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
Why?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
Um, just about everyone.
Whats his problem?
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
What?
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.
Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Not the way youre thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
How did you know that was me?
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
Yes.
But nothing did.
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Yeah. You?
Hi.
Yeah.
Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
But where is my daddy!?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Goodnight, Daddy...
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
Where did it come from, Mama?
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Who is they?
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
No mam -- I looked all over.
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
Who's Miss Johnson?
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Well, let me have it.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
There, you see?
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
What is this?
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
What?
Okay.
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Did you bring the pie and punch?
What Cartman?!
Mph rm rmph!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
No... The General is right.
What's the password?
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
It's okay, I am done for.
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Does it say what the clitoris is?
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
You don't care.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
What is it?
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
You don't have watches?
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Well I appreciate that.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
That's clear.
Really?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
I can't let you do that.
I don't know what we're facing.
Sure.
Dawn!  Dawn!
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
Dawn.  Come in.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
So close...
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
How am I supposed to know?
You're not from around here, are you?
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Where'd you get this ball?
I got a right. You're my father.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Hello?
It depends.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
You know who I am?
Nice set-up.
Yeah.
He's not here.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
No, I'm fascinated.
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
Nothing.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
Come on, bargain with me.
I could let them go for ten.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
Why should I help that old fuck.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
I am a professional man.
You guys got something going on downstairs?
Open it, Captain!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
Fletcher, get away from there...
Fletcher!  Now!
Yeah.  I heard you.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
That's our reserve air.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
Edmunds?
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
What caused it?
They've left, keep watching!
I did.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
Because when we get down there --
Wait -- down where?
Underwater?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
It never occurred to me.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Norman!
What do you mean -- not normal?
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
You did, didn't you?
Forget the sub.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
You don't believe me.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
What?
But how?
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Something for burns.
Parasolutrine?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
The sphere looks different.
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
Do you fear them?
He can't manifest.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Then where's it coming from?
Stop it!
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Where's it coming from?
You holding up alright?
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
What is that?  That noise?
You don't understand about the sphere.
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
What happened to her?
She's cracking, Norman.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Push her, c'mon.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Gimme a second --
Well, press something!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
Think about it.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
Does this mean what I think it means?
Captain who?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
How can you store an energy field within you?
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
You mean we should go after her!...
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
Have you been checked out?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
I found it... It's just not there.
This isn't going to work.
I think she's going to be all right.
Is he afraid of the water?
No!...
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
How do you make him do that ?
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
I'm all ears.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
Funny...
I'm sorry, Carmen.
Zander, what are you doing ?
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
I'm gonna miss you.
Shhhh...!
Should I be ?
What's wrong with you ?
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Hi, mom.
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
<U>Why</U>...?!
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
Yes.
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
Captain, what's the next move?
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Time to impact...?
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
The point... 
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Sure plan to.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
Why did you quit?
Yes.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
Of course.
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
You'd know better'n me.
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Later on.
Then I'll come back, then.
You can do it.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
...yes.
That's right...
Where you going?
It does?
Pelting down out there.
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
But that's what happened.
Yes, that's right.
I've been thinking.
I wasn't doing business.
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
I'm sorry.
They're holding it for ransom.
Wat...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
It's Marty on the Coast -
How big is this horse?
Fifteen hands.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
They think it's your First Wife...
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
Bobby, don't say anything.
What do you drink?
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
Her...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
You do...?
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
Why?
But we...
Will you help me out...?
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
And you know what...?
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
I'm only trying to...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
You show Claire these sketches?
Why not?
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Doug, the traffic light...
Arrest him.
What is the...?
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
How about that.
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
Sure.
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
Not now.
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
No, what is it?
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
My oh my.
That's what I said.
It's just a formality.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
We don't have the money.
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
Do something.
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
It takes all kinds.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
You think so?
Bet you did.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Look she's upset --
That happens.  To families.
I hope it's the right kind.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
What if he's kidnapped?
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Not use my words, please!
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
That's Rache's song!
No!  I have to get there.
Before you.
But you can still see him.
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
We...
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
We're going to win this.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
We don't have any coffee.
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
What did you do?
Get out!
Look, I...
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
Not personally.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
Yes?
You feeling all right?
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
Moi?
And you said...?
I really look like shit.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
That's not wh...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
I trust you of course I do but --
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
I needed some time away.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
I did not go to high school.
I'm still poor.
I'm always working.
Who is Jesus?
My baby.
My grandchild-baby.
Oh. How did it happen?
So whaddya think?
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
Yes, Mikey?
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
You mean, again?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
The same. Same as what?
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Thanks.
...gger.
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
That's good.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Three.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
What now?
--be prepared.
Let's move it we got company!
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
Enjoying the tour so far?
Are you going to kill us?
I don't want any...
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Dissent?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Possibly some coffee?
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
That's government property, Major.
Well, Mister President.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
You're right, sir.
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Plan-R????
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
I suppose they are, sir.
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Go on, Major.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
How long will it take to receive them all?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
What else could it be?
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
What's your point, Lothar?
Master safety.
Primary bomb is live.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Maybe the warning system's out.
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
At the bottom of mines?
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Mm-hm.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Hey, you said you did a video?
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Yeah.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
No, no.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Really?
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Well, that's one way of putting it.
I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
I can come visit?
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
I'd like to.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Yeah?
It's coming along.
Two-fifty.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Sooze wants to see him.
What? What'd you do?
You lied to me.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Look, why do you care, huh?
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Um, because you didn't want to go.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
No, I don't.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
God, you smell like whiskey.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Where are you going?
To his hotel?
Wait. What, what are you saying?
'Bye, Jeff.
Hey, Pony.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Sorry.
So you think I should?
Really?
Yeah, really.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
What do you mean?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Look, get down off my property.
I hope you're happy!
No, this has everything to do with you.
It's stupid.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
I'm moving.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
You do?
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
What are you going to do? Hm?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Hey, Tim.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
And they get caught!
She thinks you went to the police.
Hi, Jack.
Yeah.
I sure do.
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
You're kidding.
Hannah, we've...
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
What the hell do you want?
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
Hi, Artie.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
Are you hungry?
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
Into what? A lampshade?
O.K.  Where's the cash?
You're tough, all right.
What were you -- a child actress?
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
What's the matter, Norma?
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
It's a good script, isn't it?
Or shall I call my servant?
I knew there was something wrong with them.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
Well?
I wrote that with my heart.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
You'll like it here.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
How about some evening clothes?
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Who?
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
Go away.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
Good night.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
That's a lie!  They still want me!
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
You heard him.  I'm a star!
I'm not here.
Whose room was this?
What doctor?
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
How's that about your being my friend?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
What is it?
What does it mean?
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
He will be. In about five minutes.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
Western Europe.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
I have to.
When can I see, you again ?
You love me?
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
This is my favourite place in the city.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
What's that?
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
She said it wouldn't last.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
I know it.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
What are you making:
I can do that.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
How'd you do that?
Your hair looks the same.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
No, MR. Danvers.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Nigel, get lost.
I have to talk to you.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Others?
Are you happy, Zaltar?
Zaltar, please help me.
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
Then teach me how.
What are you talkin' about?
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
Uh-huh.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
I know, I'm the fault.
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
What about this week's check?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Hey, boss.
Turn on the T.V.
God, that's what I keep you for.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Is this blackmail?
A computer.
Everything.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
I know, by computers.
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
Thank ...you.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
There's no rush.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
Okay? Goodbye.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
She's not his mama either.
Small potatoes.
What's wrong?
I don't?
Actually, yes.
Really?
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Lois, you're amazing.
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
Lois, I really don't see why --
Mush!  Mush!
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
I asked the right question.
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
DELETE IN CUTTING
To ski?
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
So this is the planet Houston . . .
What shall we do now?
Gee, I don't think . . .
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
I'm not so sure you do.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
Where's Clark?
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
Boy, are you gonna get it.
We'll all fry.
You think he'll find us.
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
You are . . .
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
One of them should've been you.
It was hot, yes.
Keep warm now.
But otherwise it's swell.
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
Oh.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Your father was a sick weirdo.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
I'm wearing it.
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
Two.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
Lois, the kickback story...
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
Sure.
I gave him this new face.
Is that real enough for you?
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
They'll soon be over.
How are you?
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Yes...fine.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
They just finished supper.
Are you sure?
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
I'm not sure.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Your kids never cry.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
For rabbits?
From what?
Did they give him special care?
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Away from your crazy Mom.
And winter?
Nicole!
What's a ditty again?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
I'm in a car wash.
News?
Don't you want to hear?
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
Who did they get for that?
So you're just the thing we need.
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
No.
Yes.
Before the actual accident?
You saw the speedometer?
What's so funny?
How do you like it, Nicole?
Are you sleeping?
What do you mean?
What's going to happen to Dolores?
I don't know.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
Susie, I'm sorry if---
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
Not "we", Sidney, you!
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
She knows now.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
I don't think so.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
Take a top coat.
You're talking very fast.
Did you now?  On which bounce?
Like you?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Those lying motherfuckers!
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Out of the way, John!
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Why attack Russia?
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
I guess so, sir.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Yeah.
With more what? More what?
Colonel. Pleasure.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
What museum?
Think you can get me any of that?
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
I don't buy that.
Why were they going to arrest you?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
I wish to say something.
Tell me about von der Null.
Von der Null?
I have no idea.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
That's what I asked.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Do you know what's in this archive?
It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.
Yes, you remember.
Show me.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
One of your people told me.
And ask him about his private life.
So, you never heard of him.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Can you handle it?
I hate the beige one.
What's it to ya?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
What?
You volunteered?
Bag some Z's?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Let's go.  Time to move out.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Good fighters.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Someone?
Sarah.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Here, drink some of this...
I can't sleep.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Did you play recently?
Clean out your locker.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
This can't be real...
Alright... okay...
What are you talking about?
Home.
You're the one who started running.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Seriously?  What did they say?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Do you mind if I sit?
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Wha... ?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
That's not true...
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
Single?
Why?
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
What have they been doing to you?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Do you know how to change a tire?
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Have you gone to the police?
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
May I make two suggestions... ?
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
You know, these fit... perfectly.
You did?  How is he?
Fine.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
What's the trouble?
What's this about?
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
What's happened...
What?
Luke, can I talk to you?
Sure.
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
You want company?
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
Sorry.
And then what happened?
What happened?
That's where she hanged herself.
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
It's all I could afford.
No.
I've never had a pedicure before.
Is that a problem?
As soon as you get dressed.
Anything but Japanese.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
Italian.
What's the matter?
How they goin', kid?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
This is un-fucking professional.
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
And that's where you met Jenny.
What?
You goin' back inside?
Too easy?
Do you have any friends, man?
What d'you say, Elaine?
Well, those are the breaks.
Been busy, have you.
She never told Eddie, though.
How'd you manage that, then.
Modelling.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
I might've been away for the weekend.
Something like that, yeah.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
My employer.
What line is he in.
I bet.
Tell us about it.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
Only in the movies.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Where's Big Sur?
Up the coast.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
Where is he now?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
I don't get it.
Is he here?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
Who?
Look, I'm no expert, but--
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
...Uh-huh.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
You got the dough?!
No. I--tell me--
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...I don't think so.
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
So--
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Uh-huh.
...You sure, Eddie?
Yeah.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
Crane. Ed Crane.
...You're Ed Crane?
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Not an owner.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Uh... you're under arrest.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Behind you.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
What is it?
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Curious.  There's something missing.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
What are they?
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
We will.
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Read it out loud.
You work here?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
We're not supposed to go back there.
Oh... my... God!
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
You were going to be married.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
Dr. Green...
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
That was D'Agosta.
We have to try and draw it off!
How?
Help someone!
What?
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
You want to book the flight?
He doesn't care.
That and a fat, new contract.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Now.
I've got to talk to you.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
--we need more charcoal.
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
You're the one talking to the walls!
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
Now what?
Special Agent Scully --
You've been back to Dallas?
Working with?
What is it you find incredible?
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
Yes.
You got some kind of business with him?
What's that?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
No you didn't.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
All I told them was the truth.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
It's like jelly.
What did you find?
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
It may be extraterrestrial.
What are you doing?
What? What happened?
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
About what?
Agent Mulder --
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
What are you doing?
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
A virus?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
Do you think that's funny?
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Well look at that.
He's mine?
What now?
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Delano?
What's wrong?
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Is she alright?
You're looking well.
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Give her some cigarettes.
You were awfully good.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
When...what did you do?
Oh, that was many years ago.
Tell me more.
...and buried him.
I'm so sorry.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
What happened to your hand?
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
No.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
They'll be returned, miss.
What are you trying to say?
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
Didn't I?
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Shall I go over there, sir?
I'll look it up for you.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
What about?
Yes.
She's been arrested.
You can get somebody else...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
You've got plenty of contacts.
...your address?
Martins.
Thank you.
In great pain?
Speak English?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
I was told that he did not die at once.
The Roumanian?
That's all you meant?
I'm Daffy.
Richard. Hi.
Help you out?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
A shark fin?
Bonsoir.
Francoise -
We lost our key.
No one follows that midrash.
Watch your language....
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
I don't, but...
Yeah, but not on the letters.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
You're not in school? What do you do?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Is he a Nazi?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
What do you care?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
Fuck that.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
What'd you say?
Why are you taking that?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
An investment banking house.
You wouldn't announce it?
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
And Jewish men like to get it.
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Why would Nadelman lie?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
Give me a reason not to.
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
I always won.
I thought you hated Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
I can't help what I think.
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Balint?
Do you feel you're making progress here?
What is happening?
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Who told you that?
Shut up. Fuck you....
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
I can tell....
You missed on purpose.
"Do chickens give milk?"
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Are you going to keep it?
Does he know?
Did you tell him?
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Good afternoon.
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
I tell you she's mine!
You know each other?
Congratulations.
You forgot the Hula!
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
What else is there?
I won't, I swear.
He can learn.  He is learning.
Why?
Lira?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Yes?
Is he here?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Great!
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Your mother?
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
That's good.
Don't you have a heater?
Please, have a seat.
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
I didn't dive.
What's wrong?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
What?
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
What?
What is it honey... the frenchy?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
Mordechai?
Yes Esther.
You two know each other?
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
You okay?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
I drink.
I sleep it off.
You really think so, Charlie?
They don't say it to me.
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
Come to look around?
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
Why did you give up teaching?
I thought they came right past here 
That's a fact, isn't it?
Get it out of here!
That's easy. Me.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
On his back, I suppose.
You're too good to me.
Clo-Clo?
Are you all right?
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
Who was the other man?
What did he have to do - look at the body?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
What! You can't be --
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
When will they be back?
I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
You lost my money?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
When did you get back?
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
My brother hung himself.
...You-you spoke to him?
Good.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
A recent acquisition. Weve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flats been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
Then find another way.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Yeah.
How much of a hurry are you in?
No... No...  I swear...
Its not.
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
I hope its not too significant.
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Recommended?
The 1,000 is on account.
10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Lets go.
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Maybe I dont.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
Three oclock.
Can I get up now?
He just said he had good reasons.
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Im afraid I dont understand.
Do you know Leons parents names?
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just aint worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of em.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Fuck...
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Cost what?
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Now?
Who do they think I am?!
Well...
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
No, but...
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
But... why... what's the point?
I want to stay with you...
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
Why?
To avoid killing anyone.
No, I... I held it up to...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
We want her burned as a witch!
Trial?  What trial??
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
And may I go to Mass?
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
What difference does it make where she comes from?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
My captains have sworn their support.
If there was, I didn't see it...
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
For what?
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
The wind will be against us...
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
No!
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Who... who are you...?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
They're going to come and visit you in here?
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
Why did she have to die?
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
I want to be with him always...
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
How long have you been married?
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Calm down, what, what is it?
wish I knew you better.
Can you help?
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Pig!
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
Sorry, I don't remember.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
There is something to be said for silence
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
I'd like to make a swap.
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
What did she say?
What's in here then, lead?
Do I know any gigs?
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Which way are the rooms?
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
Mottola.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
You just worry about your end, kid.
You think he'll show?
You in?
Look at that.  He's got four apes with him.
Raise 300.
Who are you?
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Yeh, he knows that.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
I'll make parole.
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Dorothy!
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
I didn't.
You know, we know each other.
Not that scrawny little....? 
Yes.
Dead?
Forgive me.  How are you?
You see how much we have to say.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Only in bad weather.
Better get home before it is.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Gilbert!
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What about this Nunheim?
Trail him!  Trail who?
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Could this be him?
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
He telephoned me today.
I didn't know they had a fight.
That's ridiculous.
Good morning --
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Chris!
All right.  All right.
What are you going to do?
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
I trust you.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Where's Gilbert?
I've never heard about you.
I had him out this morning.
You might have mentioned me first.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
What hit me?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I never saw that before.
You did.
So am I.
He was down in the shop.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Wynant's body?
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
What are you going to do?
Yes.
I don't know.
No, Mr. Charles.
Nick Charles here?
Where are you going?
Home?
I'm fired.
A casual one.
What are you doing.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
We can't just go off and--
Epps!
You're the one with all the ideas.
Maybe I do.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Give it to me!
At-at-at-at-at.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
You think?
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
What does it look like I'm doing?
Is it dead?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
He's not going to leave us.
Why do I have to stay down here?
Wes might be right about that.
No.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
Yeah.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Don't you touch it.
What did you say?
Can't you--
What do we do?
To where?
Is that good, or bad?
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Somebody has to.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Epps.
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
What?
Woods.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
What does that mean?
He says it's a box.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
Yeah.  So?
You ever think about dying?
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
Stress category.
Drug evasion with....
Vocasity
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
It's the end.
What's going on....what are you doing?
THX and me.
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
I'm leaving.
What?
No......  She's dead THX........
Where's LUH?
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  Check cybernetic manual F-45.  If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation.  This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are.  Authorities will arrive shortly.
Coffee, Mike?
Oh yeah? Prove it.
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Look, it's a longshot...
I terrible with mechanical things.
Should we head for the Interstate?
Yeah, another round thing.
Political.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
You don't fish.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
A what?
Captain...
Goddamit, Reilly--
Yes, sir.
Yes.
And diamonds in the front.
Well, have you found it?
No!
Eleven o'clock! 
About tonsils.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
No.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Just dull.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
No, not at all!
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Five, seven, and nine--
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Yes.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
That's what you need!
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
You think that's too much?
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Together.
Crimson!
Yes, I would!
Any minute I want!
On the night table.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
You look beautiful.
Yes, madame!
Well--uh--yes and no.
To me he seems rather nervous.
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
No--I'm sorry.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
My God... Cal. Is it a --
Bollocks.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
How cold?
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
Now it's worse.
You have to go for help.
Will this work?
It's getting quiet.
I'm so cold.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
Sure!
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Good afternoon--
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Montana?
Will you pardon me?
Where'd you get it?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Like her paint job?
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Never eat before the show.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Very--your mother?
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Thanks.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
Sally--!
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
You can live that down, can't you?
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Well, I'll be--!!!
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
This is a business trip!
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
Change?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
You take some awful chances.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
You keep it-- 
Where did you hide it?
That goes two ways.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
I'm going to the show--
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
I should say not.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Yes--Me--in person!
Hello, Denby!
Who won?
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
Like it?
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
No--not much--excepting-- 
Do what--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
Somebody's got to do it--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Get that out of your trunk.
What for?
He's all right.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Why?
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
What!--are you crazy?
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Yes, very.  And very married.
Where'd you get that horse?
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
But wait, you don't understand-
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Since when is faro a business?
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Very cosmopolitan.
Very instructive
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
All right.  Then what?
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Don't touch me!
You really look awful.
Praise Jesus!
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
You'd die for fun?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
What's wrong?
I hate Sadie.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Mattie.  What about this?
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
Yeah?
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
That a fact?
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
I appreciate your time -
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Your new car. 
Wait a minute -
Is this another one of your games?
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
Fishing?
That's reassuring.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
If I were you -
- You're not.
Why don't we just take these -
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Sorry I'm late -
I am. What do you want?
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Approaching the first gate.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Will the cruise set it off?
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
What did your wife get her?
Junior spends time with his child.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
Why does he always pick on me?
Do you think you won?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
Did you ever have to use this thing?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
I'm worn out.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
It's good to be able to hear that.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
Man, act like this is your home.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
You should go back and rest.
Harry, you know everything.
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
I was just trying to make conversation.
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
What?  What is it?
We're almost there.
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
I dunno.
I don't know!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
They're getting bigger.
What the heck is up there?
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
I want to go home.
She'll have to learn.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
You're not so old yourself!
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
How much do I pay him?
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
Don't bother.
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Why?
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Oh, it is?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
You all right?
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
I don't know.
Okay, young lady, that's it.
What do you think it is?
Arizona.
When will you do it?
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
So you pay off our customs officials?
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
You first.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
A group of us are going out tonight.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
If I can.
But will he be house-trained?
It could mean that, yes.
Any way we can do it better?
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Where's that?
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Sorry.
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
Well, it isn't.
Smells like it.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Right.
Nightmare.
You don't know, do you?
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
That's your theory?
You know.
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
Excellent.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
Yeah.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
Went ballistic?
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
We go for a walk.
A walk.
Homeless people?
Qual se tu?
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
My pain?
Position, Bird of Prey?
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
You caught me on my way to the shower.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
Not General Korrd.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Captain, what have I done -
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Hmmm?
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?


Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
He's not?
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Each man's pain is unique.
I hide no pain.
Spock?
I belong here.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Senior exec.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
What do you want with the Pentagon?
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Where did you hear that name?
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
Not us, I hope.
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
How did you do that, Flynn?
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
The Users...you really think they're still there?
I'm shocked.
You bitch.
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Yeah, right.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Harry!  Where are you!
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Guy's a spook!
Yeah, but for who?							*
Give me the page.
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
Now what?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
Any minute now.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
Yes.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
I'm late.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
Do you still love your husband?
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
No.  But I wanted to.
What?
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
That was you?!
Tell me what happened?
And you chased one?
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
The forager's back.
I didn't get any chicken.
Tell him we gotta go.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Tell him to look through it.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
I took a cab.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
What time is it?
There's nothing to tell.
Ask me them again. One by one.
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
Do you get paid a lot?
Four hundred bucks.
"Heroes For Sale"?
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
Uh-huh.
A real live pimp?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
I don't believe so.
No no no no no no no no no...
Where you goin', honey?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
How come?
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Where the fuck is that bitch?
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Money problems?
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
What the fuck did you bring that for.
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Where's everybody else?
Say it, goddamn it!
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Thank you very much, Clarence.
I'm really not very -
She seems very nice.
Do tell. Why drug related?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Keep it.
No.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
You and Robin moved?
You do more than try.
He saw the wire.
What was I sayin'?
Rock whores.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Preach on, Big D.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Put it in your pants.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you know where we can find him?
No.
I understand.  There'd be no point.
They forced me to take drugs.
And your only goal is...???
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
I have to go.
1995?
What?
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
The guy was a total fruitcake.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
You... you couldn't have heard me.
Why are we doing this?
What's that mean?
You do know me.  You helped me once.
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
You really want to know?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
Hey!  You there!
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
That a fact?
I think I've heard that before.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Will be.
It will.
I need a ticket.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Yep.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
What time is it now?
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
No charge.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
What you want?
Open up!
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
We ain't got no Beck's.
Kirin?
Genuine Draft?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
What was that all about?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
You didn't hear something?
Jake, what is that?
Least you can leave.
Where you coming from?
You've been around.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Still playing?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Is it pretty?
Take me with you.
I can't.
How much money has he got?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
I wanted to talk.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
What was I supposed to do?
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
And you're not one to lie, are you?
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Who the hell are you?
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Wait a second--
Would you?
Just ran into a little trouble.
Nice office you've got.
I was hoping we could talk.
I did?
You're talking like a mad man.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
I guess I might as well get this done with.
What should I do?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
You know what I mean.
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Shut up.
Trouble with the car again?
Darrell giving you problems?
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
She's dead.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
You're fucked.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
They're not very imaginative?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
No police.
You want something?
You can't do that yourself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I think I've heard that before.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
I wasn't doing anything.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Mister!
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
An overheated car.
Live there?
I'm not rambling.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
You meant it.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
Next time you'll do just fine.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Cause she's dead.
I've had time to get over it.
For what?
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
What the hell are you talking about?
Harlin around?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Yeah, I can fix it.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
What sign?
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
No! Okay! Okay!
What you want?
No.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Accident.
You've been around.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Where you headed?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
My mother died in this canyon.
Can you make it back up?
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
Which you don't have.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
I'll keep it in my office room.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
What about the game?
You've misunderstood.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
Just one--
I mean if you knew karate?
I see.
Don't be scared.
Is that right?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Where'd you get the money, huh?
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
Are you really going to kill them?
Your wife?
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
He admit it?
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
They really got all that money, them whores?
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
William Munny, yeah.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Been gone near three years now.
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
You missed him? You didn't...?
Yeah, he's in there.
Is it him?
Did... you... get... him?
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
I can't see 'em.
You could have it. All of it.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Three ways?
You ain't like that no more.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Yeah... you said that last night.
No.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Just like that?
Yeah.
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
They'll never stop.
I love you.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
This is not right.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
I was out of line.
Maybe more.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Ready?
The answer is no.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
We want to meet him.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
When does he post bail?
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
No, no, no, no, no.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
You know Ruby is in Attica?
He didn't have my lawyer.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
The D.A. gave me immunity.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
This is totally irrelevant.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
You're stalling, Verbal.
Wait a minute.
Then why didn't you help him?
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
Keaton was Keyser Soze
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Nothing.
Very good.
Four cases in three years ...
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Yes.
Gruber...
What does it mean?
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
And what did your team do...
Well, we...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Orthopedics?
I know of him.
Huh!
No further questions.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
I...
I thought I would need it.
What is this going to cost?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
She getting good care over there?
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
I.  Yes.  It is.
... and you're going to do that?
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected ...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
What is it?
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Exception!
Mr. Alito, please.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
This is Miss Costello...?
Kathy Price.
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Laura.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
Do you want me to go...?
Why don't you get some rest?
Yes.
If I don't 'grow up...'
It's over!
Dr. Gruber.
Hi, Mickey ...
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
Uh ...
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
What do you want?
I'm going to help her.
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
...four years ago...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
I just saw her.
What?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
I used to be a nurse.
What did she say?
Yeah.
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Yes.
How'm I doing so far?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
He won't talk.
From whom?
No.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
Ernie's.
Yes.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Nothing.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Hello?
Your name. And --
Judy Barton.
Then will you for me?
No? Then what?
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
Why?
No!
No! Let me go!
You can't. You're afraid!
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
I loved you, Madeleine.
You don't remember.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
One shouldn't live alone.
Some people prefer it.
And no birds sing.
Where are you now?
Home?
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
Don't leave me... stay with me...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
And it's a all real.
Why?
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
How long has she had the room?
What's tomorrow?
Well?... what'll you do?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
From that music.
Uh-huh!
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
My... the acrophobia.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Out!
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Oh... this and that.
What I've been doing?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
She'll be out in a moment.
How soon can it be altered?
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
Can't do what?
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Why was the floor wet?
The hell you do.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
What do you think you are doing?
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
Wait. Wait a minute.
How do you figure?
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
What is your problem?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
They won't figure it out.
They're driving me nuts!
We'll be ready Adam.
That's one idea.
No. I think it's fucked.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
Have you thought about what I said?
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
Call 911.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
He's cracked up.
What is the question you asked me?
What you just said. Say it again.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Hear what?
Isn't it a little late?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
You hate women.
True.
And what happens when you can't?
What's your point?
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
What? What's your point?
What?
You said nobody would miss her.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Photographer?
I think I forgot the tent.
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
What?
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
How do you figure?
He's a moron.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
He's a great chef.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
Keith do not trivialize this.
I'm not. What's the problem?
Do you love me?
Of course.
Okay.
What!
Yeah. Sure.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
Move the bodies.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
I love you dad.
That's just insecurity.
I just want her to be happy.
Buzzing?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
Greenpeace.
Where's Boyd?
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
The stone age.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
Fucking desert.
Right.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Who is she?
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Don't you ever see him?
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
Me?
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
How in hell does it wind up?
Miss Viridiana ...
What are you doing here? Get out.
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
Yes -- very, very big!
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
What happened to me?
Have I slept long?
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
I should have told him.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
Only because I got pulled out early.
What happens if I can't catch him?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
This better not be a wild goose chase.
He hears...everything.
How do you kill it?
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
I am beautiful, aren't I?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
John died.
That's not true, Parker.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
You know I am.
Start of what?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
Can I ask you something?
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
There you go  best seat in the house.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
For Schumann.
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...

You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...

Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
The American "people"?
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Why?
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
Get on this, right now...
Our adopted land...
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.
...I just missed my plane.
Oh, God...
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
Give'em another pill...
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
ON SCHUMANN, WHO HAS CONE TO THE BACK OF THE COUNTER, AND IS EMPTYING THE CANNISTERS.
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now: How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued that group? 
YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.
We're locked into Albania.
Whaddaya think?
What do you want the kid to say?
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
Is that true?
Because.
What do we have that they want?
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
What is it?
President's speech.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
...but...
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Hell of a show.  Hell of a job, Stan.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
See y'at the Finish Line.
Shoes, Hats....
I have the White House on the Line.
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
It's tough to rhyme.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
...as of today, 89% favorable.
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
Oh, hell...
No, I think..
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
What was that?
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
So what's the problem?
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
Hi sport.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
How much?
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
How much is enough Gordon?
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
I don't.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
Hi.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
With Mark?
He still likes you
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Yeah, yeah, OK
But?
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
A party at a waxwork huh?
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Safety in numbers man.
Well divide 18 into three
Sell my soul?
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
How?
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Have you been hurt?
You were in an accident?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
I don't know.
Who?
I've never even met you.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
And then you weren't there.
You know where she is?
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
You should have heard her play.
Good.  I'm good.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
Oh...
What?
I was down in Adamant...
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Why?
In the house.  I was scared.
I'm so sorry.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Dressed?
Tonight?
Harvey says he's amazing.
What are you doing out here?
This is the Feur thing?
How do you know this?
How did you--
But then you've been so much better...
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
Do I have everything?
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
I...
Leave her out of this!
We don't know that for sure.
The leaves...
What?
I have seen him again.  Last night.
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
You're very clever, aren't you...?
If that were true, I would not be here.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
Harder...
I'm glad you're around to say it.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
Do you love me, Michael...?
Hello..
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
You look a little green.
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
You did that, didn't you...?
Stop it!
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Rowan Mayfair.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
I thought you were someone else
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Sure...
Oh, about six years since I graduated
I don't know
What didn't you like about her?
You've killed but you're not a killer
What?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
Is LESLIE here?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
That's good
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
You and your pep talks.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
I thought I loved her.
Never say never.
What gives, Don Corleone?
We reinvented ourselves.
Ladies first.  I insist.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
So that's a maybe?
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
God, you are so hot.
Of course we are.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Well?
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
I understand.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
It's not up to me.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Well? What do you think of her?
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
That's probably my office.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
I want you to trust me.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
That's part of growing up, honey.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
Oh. Goodness.
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
My father must've been amazing.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
People pay good money for that?
My parents? What do you mean?
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
Kelly Van Ryan...
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
You look pretty.
How soon can we get something?
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
And the child...
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
Take your time.
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
Then what?
You mean he withdrew...
The skinny brunette.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Where's Lombardo?
Where's this coming from?
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Just tell us what happened.
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
A ride.  You want one?
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Get off my property.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Hi, Mon.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
What?
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
There's nothing for them to get.
It doesn't look like it.
I had to go look for this coupon.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Yes.
Jesus, man... You okay?
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
J. S. Bach.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
That's a lot of butler.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
You might have mentioned you had that.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
No record of him.
It's not a guy...
I know!  I know!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
He had a pressing engagement.
Now it's a bomb.
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Why did you say that?
Are you a warrior?
You gotta promise to feed her.
You?
Who?
Want me to carry Elora?
You must learn magic.
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Obviously.
Maybe milking.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
John, why?...
Nail it!
I saw him.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Have you got your gun on now?
Oh, he's good.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
But why would they murder...
Where are you taking us now?
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Does anybody know I'm here?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Tell him his tea stinks.
Buttons are Hochmut.
The... bullets?
You know carpentry?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I was being foolish?
Aren't you? After today?
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
She say where he is?
What about Carter?
Is this where we're going?
I wish dawdie was with us.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
If she...
...have you come back?
Hickory!
Run, Toto, run!
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
How did you guess?
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Oh --
Oh --
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
We might.
Lions and tigers and bears!
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
How about a hippopotamus?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Um-hmm.
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
The other side....
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Yeah.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
And you're going to lead us.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Where -- where do we go now?
You humbug!
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
Whozat?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
You don't get around us that easy!
Quiet!
We do.
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Ha -- ha -- ha --
It's a whozis.
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Oh, dear, dear.
Yeah --
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
It makes you nervous?
But I still want one.
He is an impostor.  Theres no Davidov at Miratom.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Whos she?
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
He survived?
Im sorry.
I cant stay here.
No!  It will cave in!
What is it?
I dont want to be safe!
I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Now...where were we?
And the payoff on the tables?
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Ill send someone out.
Your father...
This is the end.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
What?!
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
Don't call me that.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
No.  I just wanted you to --
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
. . . What?
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Coward.  Giving up.
We should get back --  What?
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
Their real names, please.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
New information.
What is this place?
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
What do I get out of it?
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
Who are you?
We hung out last night, remember?
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
Where are we going?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
Aren't you afraid?
He's shut out the communication circuit!
Sit down.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
Are you all right?
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
What is it you intend to do to me?
Come with me and I'll let her live.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
To find Rogue.
He helped you?
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Baack!
What?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Promise??
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Love me?
Darling!?!
What a strange fellow.
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
This is the only library I know of.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
No, Fred ereck.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
What wockers?
What?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
Throw the second switch!
What?
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
But you did -- I just heard it.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Well...
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
Right here?
I thought it was wonderful.
I'd be so nervous.
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
Give him the sedative!
Why don't we talk inside?
Yes, I will.
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
